260 NOTES.

unum egregii mortalem allique silenti: Epod. XII, 4: sagacius unus
odoror. In the text the Mss. carelessly have unum before convenil, where
it gives no adequate sense.

102. 2. constitutas, “set in order '' ; sor the Stoic did not, any more
than other ancient philosophers, believe in an actual creation of the world
by the gods, that is, a creation out os nothing. Comp. note c. 35, 88. In
the passage sarther on: ab animantibus principiis ea csse generata, it is
only intended to say, that the existing divine sactors in the creation of the
world, themselves issued stom the elemental ether, the 7-‘5201 σπερματικοί
(Plut. De Plac. Phil. ¹, 7, 17; Diog. L. V11, 148), or the δυνάμεις γόνιμοι
(as M. Aurel. lx, ι extr. calls them) which are spirit and matter in one,
have caused later created things to issue srom themselves. It must how·
ever be confessed that this proposition does not really belong here, where
the discourse was to be, not of the origin of things, but os the government
of the world. ,

102. 8. ea esse generata. The Mss. have eam . . . generatam, which
would refer to sentiens natura. But by this last expression we can only
understand, as the subsequent explanation ἓξ 81-86 shows, the soul os the
universe, i.e. the portion of the original deity entering into the universe
(see Introd.‚ p. 8), which first manifests itsels in the λόγοις σπερματικοὶς,
Cicero’s animantibus principiis, but is by no means created by thern.

102. 12. simulacra . . . imagines. The change of expression does
not denote a difference in the views os these philosophers, but the two
words are synonyms employed for the sake os variety. Comp. Ι, 12, 29
where the gods of Democritus are also called imagines,· and 1, 26, 74.
It is quite true however that the εῖδωῗα os Democritus differ from those os
Epicurus in this, that the latter proceed srom the divine beings existing in
the intermundia ,· the former arise srom the atonis flowing forth from the
sormless divine substance (see note on 1, 43, 120)‚which take various forms
by their own agency. Comp. Papencordt De Atomic. Doctr. (Berolin.
1832), p. 70 ; and Schoemann's essay De Epicuri Theolog. in his Opusc.
Ac. IV, p. 353.

102. 12. quodam pacto negat. This is true in a greater degree os
Epicurus, whose so-called gods were hardly worthy the name, than of
Democritus, whose gods were not entirely without influence on the affairs
of men. See above 1, 43, 120.

102. 18. vi magna incitata. A necessity assumed to be orzffinal,
and yet set in action by any other force, would be a contradiction. vi
magna then is not to be translated ‘¹ hy a powerful sorce,'' but ¹⁴ with pow-
erful force‚” [abl. modi] ; and incitata is to be taken in a medial, not a
passive sense [“ acting powerfully ’'J.
