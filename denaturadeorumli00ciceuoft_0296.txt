264 NOTES.

Ctesibius, a complicated hydraulic machine. Censorin. D. D. Nat. c. 23,
speaking of the introduction of both into Rome, says: Illud satis constat,
nullum (solarium discriptum) in soro prius suisse quam id, quod M. Va-
lerius ex Sicilia advectum ad rostra in columna posuit (ann. 481); deinde
aliquanto post P. Cornelius Nasica censor ex aqua fecit horarium (ann.
595), quod et ipsum ex consuetudine noscendi a sole horas solarium coep-
tum vocari.

ss 105. 30. sphaeram3 a so-called planetarium, to represent the plane-
tary system and its motions, with wheels fitting into one another ; of course
not like the modern ones with clockwork, but still mox-ed apparently by
means of an ingenious hydraulic mechanism: machinatione quadam as is
said below c. 38, 97. Cicero, Tusc. Ι, 25, 63 speaks of one that Archi-
medes had: Archimedes, cum lunae, solis, quinque errantium molus in
sphaeram inligavit, ffcit . . . ut tarditate et celeritate dissimillimos motus
una regeret conversio. Comp. F abr-ic. on Sext. Emp., p. 577; and Biblioffi.

what follows it must be remembered that mundus, like the Greek κόσμος,
really denotes the world not from the material but from the formal point os
vieW. Plin. H. N. 11, 4: Nam quem κόσμον Graeci nomine ornamenti
appellaverunt, eum nos a peifitta absolutaque elegantia mundum,· Plut.
Plac. Phil. II, 1 : Πυθαγόρας πρῶτος ὠνόμασε τὴν τῶν ‹3an περιοχὴν κόσμον
ἐκ τῆς ὲν αὐτῷ τάξεως, Comp. Ideler on Arist. Meteor. 1, p. 325. The sub-
stance of the world too according to the Stoics was not created (see note
c. 30, 75), but proceeded from the original existence which is also the
highest god, just as all the individual gods which bear rule in the world
proceeded from him. But these gods that have thus corne into being also
take part in the arrangement and order of the world ; the world, becoming',
gradually developing itself‚ is sashioned and ordered with their cooperation ;
and so has become a mundus or κόσμος, a symmetrical whole. The supreme
god is the architectus (5 90); the inferior gods are his servants and aids.

106. 2. Archimedem. On his sphaera see note on 34, 88. It was
set up on the arx at Syracuse (Ox-id. Fasti VI, 279), and enclosed in a
glass case or ball, as we gather from the description os Claudian. Epigr.
18 (68). Marcellus brought it to Rome and placed it in the temple os
Virtus. Cic. De Re Pub. Ι, 14.

106. 5. apud Acelum. In his Aledca, as is seen from Nonius, p. 90,
where the ninth of the following verses is quoted.— Verse 4, reflat. The
shepherd takes the ship sor a monster that, snorting (spiritu), blows away
