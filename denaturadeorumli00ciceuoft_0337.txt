144. 33. ad harmoniam canere mundum. The Pythagorean view
of the harmony os the spheres is jocosely caricatured by Cotta. What
Pythagoras really meant may be seen in the Somn. Scip. c. 5: Quis lzic,
inquam, quis est qui complet auris meas tantus ct tam dulcis sonus? llic
est, inquit illc, qui intervallis coniunctus imparibus, scal tamen pro rata
portione distinctis, impulsu ct matu ipsorum orbium conficitur, ct acula
cum gravibus temperans varios aequabiliter concentus cfficit‚· ncc enim
silentio tanti motus incitari possunt, cl natura sert, ut extrema ex altera
parte graviter, ex altera autem acute sonent. Comp. Marfin, Etudes sur
le Time'e de Platon 11, p. 35 ff.

144. 35. non artificiose ambulantis. See ΙΙ, 22, 57.

145. 3. quasi cognatione continuata. See ΙΙ, 7, 19.—F0r the sol· -33
lowing llla . . . naturae viribus comp. note on 11, 9, 25.

145. 5. [continerentur‚ cohaerent et permanent. We have given
here the reading of Baiter 11. The passage which Cotta refers to is II, 7,
'19: llaec (Le. several operations of nature just mentioned) itafieri omni-
bus inter sc concinentibus mundi partibus profi-cto non possent, nisi ca uno
divino et continuato spiritu continerentur. The ea there refers to the op-
erations of nature in question, and it seems more natural to take it in that
sense here ; and Cotta has already said, ξ 27, A'aturae ista sunt . . . omnia
cientis et agitantis motibus δια, having in mind certain phenomena of
nature. He goes on to say Illa (these same natural phenomena) coliae-
rent et permanent naturae viribus, i.e. this consensus is due to the force
of nature and no divine influence is necessary to explain it. In estque in
ea ἃς. we take ea to refer to natura]

145. 7. consensus, quam συμπάθειαν Graeci vocant. Comp. De
Div. II, 14, 34: cx coniunctione naturae et quasi concentu atquc consensu,
quam συμπάθειαν Graeci appellant. Also the same, ΙΙ, 60, 124 and 66, 142.

145. 10, quae Carneades adferebat. See note on I, 2, 4. Sext. ἐξ·
Emp. IX, 138 ff. gives some of the following arguments of Carneades out
of his discourses, made public by his disciples, especially by Clitomachus.
—Madvig eorrectly remarks that in the second member of the following
sentence Cicero should have written nullutn esse animal sempiternum in-
stead of nullutn esse corpus sempiternum.

145. 12. ne individuum quidem. Probably a causal conjunction
has fallen out before these words, perhaps nam. The proposition that no
body is immortal rests upon the further one that no body is indivisible
and indestructible, which Cotta also refers to in Ι, 24, 66 as an oraculum
physicorum. —- ne quidem does not amplify, but simply means “also not,'’

as it often does. Comp. below c. 17, 43.
