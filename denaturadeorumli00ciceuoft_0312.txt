mutuo for [multum] and remarksz] instead of mutuo perhaps multum
should be read; the Mss. have multum. [Kayser: motu lunae, apud
Baiter ῙΙ.]

121. 29. montes vestiti atque silvestr-(⁴53 the second expression to
detine more nearly the first. Comp. e. 64, 161: vestitusque densissimos
montium.

121. 31. [For utilitates, a conjecture of H. A. Koch, Schoemann
reads dotes] —dotes denique innumerabiles, “in short, gists without
number ‘’ with which the earth is provided, and which serve mankind partly
for nourishment and partly for other necessities of life (ad victum et ad
vitam). Denique is regularly used to close with a general and compre-
hensive term an enumeration of several particulars.—artes, which is the
reading of the Mss. for dotes, is an error in copying which often occurs;
see Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, 340; had Cicero mentioned the arts here, he
would have erred in putting together things which should remain distinct.
For the arts are invented by man; this capacity of invention is all that
nature has given him 3 they should therefore not be thrown together with
the salutary and useful phenomena and products of nature, which by their
dotes, the properties with which nature has endowed them, are useful and
valuable to men. Moreover the arts are afterwards mentioned in their
proper place, c. 59, 148. Dotes is precisely the word for the sense required

“ here. [Dotes is a conjecture of Schoemann]

ἐξ 122. 15. os . . . spiritu augetur, “the mouth is gifted with breath ”5
for augeri aliqua re is never used except os things which are to one's
advantage, useful or agreeable. But the old physiologists themselves
would hardly have acknowledged that the breath was especially of advan-
tage to the mouth ; rather as Cicero himself says, c. 55, 136, the breath is
the cibus animalis, quo maxime aluntur animantes.

122. 17. [For [ab iis] Schoemann writes ab his without brackets and
gives this note z] manditur ab his. ab lcis might have been left out here,
but still it is defensible. See Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 372.

122. 18. adversi dentes are the front teeth, as adversum corpus the
front of the body.

135 122. 21. stomachus, the oesophagus; not the stomach proper, but the

way to it. Celsus lv, 1: deinde duo intinera incipiunt ,· alterum aspe-

ram arteriam nominant, alterum stomachum ,· arteria exterior ad pul-
monem, stomachus interior ad ventriculum fertur.

122. 22. tosillas, tonsils. the glands at the back of the mouth at the
commencement of the oesophagus. Collcs saucium spectantes uvam (the

uvida), Lact. De Opis. Dei, c. 11, 9.
