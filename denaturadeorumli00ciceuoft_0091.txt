SUMMARY. 73

four of the chief forms of matter, the so-called four elements, earth,
water, air and fire. Hence heat is to be regarded as the living
principle of the whole universe (25—28). But this principle must
be conceived as possessing consciousness and reason. For since
there exists in all not simple, but composite natural bodies a supe-
rior governing power ( Ἰγεμονικόν) , to which all the rest are subor-
dinate, so there must bc a superior governing power in the uni-
verse 3 and since some subordinate parts of the universe are endowed
with reason, the superior parts must also be so endowed3 hence the
universe and this all-pervading, all-animating principle must be
endowed with reason, and the universe, since it is penetrated and
animated by this principle, must be a being endowed with reason,
divine and possessing in full divine power (29, 30). This principle
is then, as has been said, heat,¹ but a heat much puter, mucssl rnore

 

1 The principle oflieat in general, totum lzoc genus zgrneum as it is called in
§25 or calidum illud alque {gneum (ξ 23), although operating in all the three
elements, earth, water and air, yet exists independently of them as quarta pars
munda* or as a fourth clement in the aetlzcr (ᾇ 27). The common earthly fire,
liic noster zssgnis, quem usus vitae requirit, confector consumptorque omnium
(3541), appears on the contrary not as a separate element, but only as a varia-
tion or inferior form of the other. According to Cicero then three grades are
to be distinguished of this genus {qm-um,- first, the ardor caelestis, qui aether
vel caelum nominatur (§41); second, the vital heat in animals and plants,
ignis corporeus (ᾗ 41), or lzae'c noster calor, quo lzaec quae nota nobis sunt retinen-
tur et vigent (§30); third, the common sirc which only burns, destr0ys‚ dis-
solves, conji’ctor, et consumptor omnium (ᾇ 41). In other authors, as Stobaeus,
Ecl. I‚36, p. 538, only two sorts are distinguished, πῦρ τεχνικόν and πῦρ cii-exivi),
the latter being common fire, the former the two other sorts which Cicero dis-
tinguishes, which in fact possess in common the animating and preserving
power. The Peripatetics blamed the Stoics for using the one term wip of the
heavenly ether and os common fire, though others had done the same before
them; they themselves rather regarded the ether as a separate existence, a
fifth element in addition to the four common ones. See Cic. Acad. Ι, 11, 39:
Ps. Arist. de mund. c. 2, 5, with the citations of Kapp, p. 282 and Ideler, note
on Arist. Meteor. Ι, ρ. 335. VVhen‚ moreover‚ the Stoics laid down the propo-
sition that no fire can exist without replenishing as universally valid‚ so that it
might be applied to the original fire from which all things have proceeded,
they certainly laid themselves open to the attacks of their opponents: and we
find that the Academic in Bk. 111, 14, 37, makes use os this to prove that the
original fire (or the primaeval deity of the Stoics) cannot be eternal. W'e must
suppose that the Stoics really limited the proposition only to the varieties os
