134 DE NATURA DEORUM.

propositions of physics in regard to the creative principle of heat.
the soul of the universe, the divinity of the world and the heavenly
bodies (13).

All that Balbus had said about the nature of the gods is consid-
ered by Cotta as rather adapted to make even their existence doubt-
ful. Balbus had argued that the universe must be God because
there exists nothing more perfect than the universe. But even if
this were true, it does not necessarily follow from its perfection that
the universe is endowed with a soul, with reason, with wisdom. nor
that it is God (21—23). Nor can the regularity of the motions of
the heavenly bodies be cited as proof that they are divine3 if so, we
should have to consider the ebb and flow of the tide and even in—
termittent sever as gods by reason of their regular recurrence. The
further deduction of Balbus, that, since the universe is not the work
of human power or human wisdom, there must exist beings of a
higher sort than men. and hence gods, rests on an arbitrary and erro-
neous view of what is higher‚ and upon a confusion of reason and
natural force (25, 26). That too is a prejudice, that the human
reasonable soul must derive from a reasonable soul already existing
in the world. It is, says Cotta, a result of the force of nature, just
as the harmonious complex of the universe is, and no gods are
necessary to explain this (27, 28).— Next follows the argument of
Carneades, that no bodily, no living and sensitive being can be
eterna] and immortal (29-35), and the proof that the principle of fire
or heat. which the Stoics regard as living and as the source of all
life, cannot be immortal‚ inasmuch as according to their notion it
needs replenishing (35-37).—— Cotta omits the further deductiori
from this, which follows of itself: for if there is nothing which is
immortal‚ and if immortality is an essential predicate of the deity,
there can be no gods. Finally he says that the idea of deity ex-
cludes the idea of virtue, which only comports with human relations;
while again on the other hand a god is inconceivable without virtue
(38- 39)-

But granting too that the universe is God, how can we justify the
assumption of several gods? And suppose we let pass also the
divinity of the heavenly bodies; to consider eatable things as gods
is an evident absurdity; and how gods can be made out of rnen is
quite inconceivable (40-42). If we are to learn from popular belief
and tradition whom to recognise as God, we shall have all sorts,
