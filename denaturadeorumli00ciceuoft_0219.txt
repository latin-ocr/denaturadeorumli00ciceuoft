force, but as also compos divinae rationis (Augustine, De Civ. Dei VIII,
2); πολλὰ εἶδός (Simplic. in Arist. Phys. f. 33 a).

41. 34⁴. PlatonIS inconstantia. This inconsistency evidently can· 30
not be held to exist between the two assertions contained in the following
relative clause, which are not at all contradictory; but in the positive
views afterwards cited which Plato sets forth in other places. Conse-
quently Cicero should have made the clauses, in which these views are
stated, also dependent on the relative qui, opposing them to what precedes
by tamen: sor· example, qui in Timaeo (or qui, cum in Timaeo) . . .
censeat, alibi lamen sine corp. ἃς. [The opposition seems to be rather
between qui in Timaeo . . . censeat and the sentence beginning Idem et
in Timaeo. Cicero says that in these two dialogues Plato holds that
nothing can be known of the Deity, and yet in the vety same dialogues he
says that various things, mundum, caelum, astra ἃς. are God. Compare
what is said of Xenophon in the next passage: facil Socratem disputan-
tem fhrmam dci quaeri non oportere, eundemque el solem et animum deum
dicere ἃς. The clause Quod vero ἃς. merely mentions in passing another
notion of Plato on the sanie subject]

Cicero's translation of the Tim. c. 2.

42. 1. in legum libris. Namely, VII, c. 22, p. 821 A. But Velleius
either from design or carelessness has ignored Plato’s true meaning.

42. 3. ἀσώματον. Plato does not himself use this expression in the Ti-
maeus, although he does so in other dialogues. I should hesitate to take
this as an interpolation as Baiter and Heindorf do. The corresponding
Latin word incorporeus is not found as early as Cicero. Comp. Gell. V,
15, 1.

42. 5. careat etiam prudentia; inasmuch as this is only a result of
experience, and experience only a result of sense-perceptions, which are
impossible for an incorporeal being.

42. 7. mundum deum esse. Tim„ p. 34 B ; 68 E; 92 C. The God
in the universe, which is hence called God itself, is the soul bestowed upon
it by the highest God, the δημιουργός. Comp. note to c. 14, 37.

42. 7. caelum, astra, terram. Legg. VII, 22, p. 821, and X, 8,
p. 896 f. These too are divine only because the divine soul of the universe
dwells in them.

42. 8. animos. Plato calls the soul not God, but only godlike, inas-
much as it also partakes of the soul of the universe. Tim„ p. 41 C.

42. 8. quos maiorum institutis accepimus. Tim, p. 40 D ff.
Plato allowed the gods of the popular belief, as he had no reason to deny
their existence, to pass for creatures and servants of the supreme God.
