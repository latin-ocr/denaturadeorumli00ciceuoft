tioned, and one is called Herakles; but there was no general agreement in
the matter.

149. 12. Iovis (et) Asteriae. The Greek Asteria (see Hesiod
Theog. 409) was doubtless substituted by the Thmlogi, whom Cicero here
follows, for the Phoenician Astarte, the queen os heaven, or, according to
some, the queen of the moon. Her son, the Tyrian llerculcs, was called
by the Phoenicians Melkarth, king of the city, and was regarded by the
people as their special tutelary deity under whose guidance they had ac-
complished all their achievements. Comp. M iinter Relig. d. Karth., p. 46 ;

149. 13. in India, qui Belus dieitur. No mention is elsewhere
made of a Belus in India3 and if one were disposed to agree with those
who think that the region about Colchis is here referred to, which was
sometimes called India, still it is hardly credible that there was any Belus

there. It is more probable that Babylon is meant, as Gesenius suggests in
’ the Hall. Allg. Encykl. der W. u. K. VIII, 401.

149. 18. iure pontificio et more maiorum. These words are to be {i}
taken with colendis, not with didicisse. Cotta means that in regard to the
worship to be paid to the gods according to pontifical ordinance and ances-
tral usage, the only worship he feels bound to pay (e. 2, 5), he has found
better teaching from the capedunculae of Numa than from the philosoph-
ical teachings of the Stoics. Capedunculae, diminutive from capedo, a
small vessel, probably of clay, used at sacrifices. Cicero Parad. I, 3 joins
capcdines elficliles urnulas. Laelius in his discourse (see note on c. 2, 5)
had praised the simplicity and plainness of the ancient religious worship,
in which there was more genuine sear of the gods than in the ostentation
of later times, and had incidentally mentioned the capedines or capedun-
culae,· this suggests to Cotta the form of expression he uses, which he
could feel sure his listeners would understand. Comp. Non. Marc„ p. 398

149. 30. Haec Carneades aiebat. Sext. Emp. IX, 182 cites a num· ⁴4
ber of very similar conclusions of Carneades. His object was to show that
the popular belief was not a sufficient ground for regarding this οι· that
being as divine, because we should inevitably be forced to place other sim—
ilar beings in the same category; and this in the end would lead to the
grossest absurdities. Comp. c. 19, 47.

149. 35. quem . . . colunt ad occidentem. Carneades did not refer
in this to the old Italian deity, Saturnus, identified with Κρόνος, but to some
