186 NOTES.

40. 15. [Anaximandri‚ also os Miletus, an Ionic philosopher, born
about ΒΕ. 611. He held the existence of a primeval substance, ἁρχὴ,
which he called (ἤπειρον. It was undefined in quality and unlimited in
extent. There is a difference os opinion whether he considered the ἁπειρον
to be a mixture of all the elementary substances which in time separated
and assumed distinct existence, or an indefinite substance which poten-
tially contained all the others. Aristode, Phys. ΙΙΙ, 4, says that he
taught that the ἁπειρον was itself divine, contained and governed every-
thing. It is probable however that Anaximander did not express himself
very clearly on these pointS. He is said to have taught that the soul was
os the nature of air. See Ueberweg, Gesch. der Phil. 1, p. 36.]——na-
tivos esse deos, tle. that the gods had not always existed, but had come
into existence in the course os the development of the universe. Comp.
Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. XII, 2, 5, p. 239.

40. 16. innumerabilis mundos. Apparently not only the heavenly
bodies are here meant, which, as we 'know, Anaxagoras held to be gods,
but other worlds like our own. Comp. stobaeus, Eclog. 1, p. 496 ; August.

40. ¹7· intellegere. See c. 14, 36.

26 40. 18. Anaximenes, likewise os Miletus aud os the Ionic school
like Thales and Anaximander, whose disciple he is said to have been.—
aEra. He held the doctrine of an elementary substance like the air,
which he considered, as Thales did water and Anaximander the ἁπειρον,
not as mere lifeless matter, but as endowed with living soree. Stobaeus,
I, p. 56 says also that he called it god.—eumque gigni. The statement
that Anaximenes held the airy elementary substance to have been created,
not to have existed from eternity‚ is doubtless an error, diffieult to under-
stand or excuse. ex caque omnia gigni would be a more correct statement
(Stobaeus, p. 296); but that is not to be thought os here.

11 40. 22. Anaxagoras os Klazomenae, also os the Ionic school (13.c.
500), lived and taught a long time at Athens. It is very doubtful whether
Cicero and others are right in calling him a disciple of the preceding.

40. 23. primus . . . voluit. Anaxagoras passes sor the first philoso-
pher who rose to the idea of a pure, immaterial spirit. It is certain that
he held the existence osa roi-c, which as a thinking, mox-ing and regulating
principle he opposed to the original matter that contained in itselt' all the
constituents of the physical world, the so-called ὁμυιιψερῆ, and believed
the two to be essentially different. Ile called the νοῦς λεπτότατον πάντων
χρημάτων καὶ καθ(ιρώ-(ιτοι·; expressions which may be due to the want of a
more appropriate designation sor what is purely immaterial (ἀσώματον, see
