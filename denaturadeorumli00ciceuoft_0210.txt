to something new, quite different from what precedes, when porro, deinde,
iam vero or the like might have been used instead. Examples in abund·
ance may be found in Goerenz De Legg., p. 47 and Madvig De 1·'in.,
p. 476.— In what went before Velleius was speaking of the revolution of
the universe ; he now pusses on to the earth, which does not revolve, but
suffers cold and heat. The reasoning is brietiy this: The earth, as part
os the universe, is also a part of God; but the earth is subject to cold and
heat; therefore God is so subject. But as cold and heat are very un·
pleasant to men, so we cannot doubt that they are unpleasant to God ; but
this is inconsistent with his happiness. Comp. Matthiae, Vernub'chr„ p. 54.

40. ι. sio alliciatur [an emendation of Schoeinann] sor sigmficetur
in the Mss„ which nobody has been able to explain, referring to the heat
and cold mentioned immediately after. [Lachmann, Lucret. p. 351, pro-
poses sic incitetur, nnderstanding the passage to refer to what precedes ;
but the euim of the next sentence seems to forbid that. Miiller gives the
Mss. reading without emendation]

40. 6. quae, si mundus est deus. A more correct arrangement
would be quae, quoniam parles m andi sunt, si mundus es! deus See.

25 40. 9. [Luc-ili, i.e. Balbus, the representative os the Stoics in the dis-
cussion.-—Qua11a vero (vetera) sint. The passage in the Mss. is
hopelessly corrupt, the best having: Qualia vcro εκεῖ,- Mtiller leaves it
without any attempt at restoration, and Schoemann reads: Qualia vero
(celcra) sint. The reading given in the text is an emendation proposed
by Α. Weidner in the Philologus, Vol. 38, 1879. comp. Tusc. Ι, 13, 29:
Si vcro scrutari velera cl cx iis ca, quac scriptores Graecias· prodiderunt,

i.e. the earliest in point of time.]

40. 10. [Thales of Miletus, founder of the Ionic school, born about
ΒΕ. 640, lest no writings‚ but his doctrine, handed down by tradition, was
later committed to writing‚ for example, by Aristone]

40. 12. deum autern cam mentem ἃς. This sounds as if Thales
as well as Anaxagoras (c. 11, 26) recognized a spiritual, creative‚ original
being along with and distinct from matter, which is (loubtless an error.
Thales held that the primal existence was a fluid which he called ὑὸωρ;
but a living, not a lifeless fluid, and one endowcd with a ‹li-vasus κινητική ;
force and matter united in one. Man· καὶ turonus-rur ἀρχὴν says Simplic.
ad Ar. Phys. f. 6, 18. Stobaeus, Eel. Phys. Ι, p. 56, calls this δίψαμις κινητικῇ
divine: it is doubtful whether Thales called it so or not ; but he certainly
never regarded it as conseious, thinking mind. Nihil huic operi cx divina
