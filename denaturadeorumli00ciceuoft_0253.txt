Orpheus. For the allusion to him enters into the connection of the argu-
ment only on the assumption that he is adduced as an example of a non-
ens. Coinp. Lobeck Agl„ p. 349 f. The fact that Orphic doctrines are
several times mentioned in the extant writings of Aristotle proves nothing
against the present passage ; the name sei-ved as a convenient traditional
designationi for certain theological views. The opinion here mentioned by
Cicero was probably to be found in the Dial. περὶ φιλοσοφίας, See Ber-
nays, Dialoge des Arist„ p. 96.

64. ¹7- hoc Orphicum carmen . . . Cei-copis. The Pythagorean
CercopS, of whom we have no further information, was thought by some
(for example by Epigenes in περὶ τῆς εἰς Ὀρφέα ποιήσεως in Clem. Alex.
Strom. 1, p. 397 Pott.) to be the author of two Orphic poems, the
(Otjomg) κατάβασις εὶς ridor, and the ἱερὸς λόγος. The latter, often called
in the plural ἱεροὶ M>ot7 consisted of twenty-four rhapsodies and con-
tained a very extended theogony; another, likewise called ἱερὸς λόγος,
was of ethic and ascetic character. There was also a Cercops from Miletus,
to whom a Hesiodic poem, AigimiuS, was attributed ; whether he was the
same with the Pythagoream cannot be determined with certainty.

64. 22. Scyllae, Chimaer-ae. This objection is auswered by Lucret. 108
IV, 736 ff. The next one it were better not to have made, it is so very

easy to meet from Epicurus's standpoint ; the third is answered by Lucret.
IV, 780 ff.; the fourth IV, 761 ff.

64. 33. Num eadem . . . omnia sempiterna? Epicurus assumed 39
the existence os the infinite quantity of atoms only for the purpose of ex· 109
plaining the assumed everlasting efflux of the impressions from the gods.
But Cotta speaks in this passage as if Epicurus intended to prove the
immortality of the gods from the inexhaustible mass of the atoms3 and in
ἓξ 105-107 as if he used the ceaseless efflux of the divine images for the
same purpose. That is certainly an error or an intentional misrepresenta-
tion. Epicurus first assumed the immortality os the gods on account of the
πρόληψις, and then tried to strengthen the belief by appealing to the law
of isonomy. According to this law, in contrast with mortal beings, there
must necessarily be immortal ones 3 and since all other beings of whom we
have knowledge are mortal and transitory, the gods are the only ones
remaining to whom we either can or must ascribe immortality. The argu-
ment may be a weak one 3 but it is better at any rate than that which Cotta
ascribed to him. For the following objections of Cotta see the note, Sum-
mary, p. 26 ff.

65. 1. sint aliqui [mmortales. The subjunctive as modus potentia-
lis = εἷεν dv.
