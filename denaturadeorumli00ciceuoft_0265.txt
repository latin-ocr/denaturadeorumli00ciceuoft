BOOK 11.—cffl1³, 111, ἓξ 7-9. 233

80. 33. C. flaminius (Nepos), “contra auspicia profectus, signis mili-
taribus eſj'ossis, quae tolli non potuerant, et ab equo, quem conscenderat,
per capu! devolutus, . . . ab Hannibale ad Trasimenum lacum caesus est.”
Epitom. Liv. lib. xxm—The person whom Cicero calls Caelius is C.
Caelius Antipater, an annalist of the first half os the seventh century, who
had written the history of the second Punic war.

81. 3. religione . . . multo superiores. Sall. Cat. c. 12: nostri
maiores religiosissimi mortales. Comp. Preller‚ Rom. Myth„ p. 1135
Boissier, Etudes sur Varron, p. 297.

81. 4. Atti Navii. Comp. Livy 1, 36, where he is called inclitus ea 9
tempestate augur, i.e. in the time of Tarquinius Priscus. It is an error of
memory that Cicero mentions Hostilius here ; in other passages, De Repub.
11, 20, 36 and De Div. Ι, 17, 31 where the same story is told in more de-
tail, he gives it correctly.

81. 10. peremnia, auspices taken at the crossing of a river.

81. 11. ex acuminibus, “auspicium totum militare ’' says Cicero
De Div. ΙΙ, 36, 77. But it is impossible to ascertain with certainty what is
to be understood by acumina, whether the points of lances on which elec-
tric flames were sometimes seen, or the tongued flames of the sacrificial fite,
or the points of the beaks of the birds, or what not. See the citations in
Giese and Moser, Cic. De Div., p. 293.

81. 11. nulla, cum viri vocantur. The nulli viri vocantur of
the Mss.‚ which no one has ever been able to explain (comp. Schoem.
Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 275), must necessarily be thus amended. Gellius XV,
27, 3 expresses the idea more fully: cum viri ad praelium faciendum in
aciem vocabantur. While the army was forming in line os battle the gen—
eral took the auspices: is apud quem in exercitu auspicium imperiumque
erat, in tabernaculo in sella sedens auspicabatur. Sabidius in Schol.
Veron. on Virg. Aen. X, 241. When the soldiers were arranged in battle
array, in procinctu, they occupied the time while the general was taking
the auspices in making their wills before three or four of their companions:
interim ea mora utebantur qui testamenta in procinctu facere volebant,
says Sabidius in loco. A will made under such circumstances without
further formalities (sine libra atque tabulis, De Orat. Ι, 53, 228) was
legally valid. XVhen the taking of the auspices sen into disuse thesstesta·
menta in procinctu also ceased, as there was no time for making them.
This incidental remark may be here superfluou53 but it need not sor that
reason have been regarded by the critics as suspicious. It is to be considered
in the same way 2ss the similar remarks ΙΙ, 36, 91 ; 43, 111 ; ΙΙΙ, 10, 25.
The opinion of some that the testamenta in procinctu had not fallen into
disuse in Cicero's time is m'thout foundation.
