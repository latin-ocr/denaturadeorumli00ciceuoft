case her designs and aims to be seen. Sequi aliquid, “to pursue some-
thing as an end.'' —— For via progredientem comp. c. 22, 57.

¹03· 29. seminis enlm . . . An example to confirm what was just
said.

104. 1. ut Epicurus. Sext. Emp. lx, 333 gives Epicurus's own
words: ἡτῶν ohan φίσις σώματά ἐστι καὶ κενόν. Comp. Lucret. 1, 419 ε
Omnis ul est igitur per se natura duabus consistit rebus: nam corpora sunt
et imma—By the following quae his accidant, i.e. their accidents‚ is to
be understood the motion of the atoms in empty space, and the origin os
things resulting from it.

104. 3. natura constare . . . mundum ἃς. The sense is: We mean
that the world is not a mere mechanical liseless aggregate like a stone or
a clod of earth, but a. living organic whole like an animal or a plant.

104. 4. nulla cohaerendi natura, without a force of organic co-

herence working in it. Natura, like φί“σις, denotes also the δι’-ναμις ὲνοι- ·

imi-em τοῖς σώμασι, as Galen says Comm. in Hipp. Ep. 6, p. 5 init.; and
Cicero also uses cohaerere in other places os the organic combination in
one whole. Comp. c. 34, 87; 45, 115; 62, 155; Acad. 1, 7, 28: omni
natura cohaerente et continuam ,· De Leg. Ι, 8, 24: alia quibus coliae-
rerenl homines: De Orat. 11, SO, 325: u! uon adfictum aliquod sed co-
haerens cum omni corpore membrum esse videatur ,· Sen. Quaes. Nat. ΙΙ,
2 extr. : naturam corporis nulla ape externa scd unitate sua cohaerentis.
The same author, Ep. 102, calls bodies thus organically cohering continua,
in contrast to the composita, those artificially put together by external
means. On this subject Sext. Emp. lx, 78-84 deserves to be consulted.

104. 11. Eiusdemque exspirationibus &a Comp. c. 15, 40; and
46, 118, where however the heavenly bodies only are in question. The
nourishmcnt of the air and the ether by aqueous evaporations from the
earth forms part os the doctrine os the intertranssormation of the elements,
which is set forth in ξ 84.

104. 14. adspiratione aer-is. See below note c. 55, 136.

104. 15. a‘er nobiscum videt ἂρ, i.e. our seeiug, hearing and speak-
ing takes place with the help of the air. The Stoics explained sound as
resulting from the wave-like vibrations of the air when distin-bed ; we hear
when the ear receives these vibrations. Seeing results from the formation
in the air between the object and the eye of a cone of rays of light, the
apex os which falls upon the eye. l'lut. Plac. Phil. IV, 19 ; Diog. L. VH,
157. 158. But the opinions of the ancients were very various. Comp. Gell.
V, 16 and Schneider on his Ecl. Phys. ΙΙ, p. 245 ff.
