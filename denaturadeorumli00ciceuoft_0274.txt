durescit umor, ‘⁶ when the cold substance contained in the north winds ot
other objects comes to unite itself with the water.” So what follows
directly about the air, multo calore admixtus, as also a few lines before
admixtum esse calorem refer to the admixture of the material heat which
is the ether.

27 87. 3. oritur ex respiratione aquarum. See c. 33, 84: Nam ex
terra aqua, ex aqua oritur αὲν, ex abre aether. —Below c. 45, ¹¹7 however
the warmth os the air is explained by the proximity os the ether.

87. 5. quam similitudinem = cuius rei similitudinem or c. r. simile
quid. Comp. De Fin. V, 15, 42: ea sequimur ad quae nati sumus.
Quam similitudinem videmus in bestiis ,· and ibid. suam cuique rei natu-
ram esse ad vivendum ducem ,· quae similitudo in genere etiam humano

⁸28 87. 10. mundum ipsum3 the universe itself, as opposed to its con-
stituent parts. Comp. c. 12, 32: nulla pars corporis cst, quae non minoris·
sit, quam nosmetipsi sumus. So ipsius mundo c. 22, 58, and mundum

the difference between this and the earthly tire, sire in its narrower sense,

87. 10. cum alio iuncta atque conexa. More correctly it would

[The rhemum-<511 is the supreme, governing principle os the world, the
highest reason, the soul os the universe, the fiery spirit which penetrates
every thing (πνεῦμα δι’ bion τοῖ- κόσμου διῆκην); just as in man the ἡγεμονι-
κόν is the reason. Diog. L. VII, 139: οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὸν ὅλον κόσμην ζῶον
bura καὶ >amau ἔχειν ἡγεμονικὸν μὲν τὸν αἰθέρα, καθά φησιν Ἀντίπατρος
