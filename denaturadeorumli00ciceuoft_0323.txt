chiefly leguminous plants3 not however exclusis-ely, but according to
Varro R. R. 1, 23, 2 those quae velluntur e terra, non subsecantur ,· quae,
quod ila leguntur, laegtcmina dicta ,· and 32, 2: dicta a legendo, quod ea
non secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χεόροποι, χέδροπα οι- χὶὁμοπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χὲρδροποι, from χείρ and ὁρὲπω,

129. 23. nisi forte . . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under· ἐξ
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
of the preceding one is: nam non sane dubitationem affert.

¹29· 27. bestias hominum gratia· What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered, since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. 111, 20. See also what Celsus
says and what Origen etr. Cels. IV, 74 answers.

129. 30. neque ali . . . potuissent. This pluperfeet is often used in
*this way instead of the imperfect, inasmuch as the possibility of the thing
is represented as the condition which must be sultilled before the thing
itsels can take place. Comp. De Offic. II, 3, 12: neque enim valetudinis
curatio neque agri cultura . . . sine hominum opera ulla esse ῥυπόω-εί,-
Ibid. c. 4, 15: quial enumerem arlium multitudinem, sine quibus vita
omnino nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above Ι,
21, 57, is to be explained 3 and sz' potuero, often used for si potero is to be
regarded from the same point of view.

[The possibility of happening would seem to be a necessary condition
to the actual happening of any thing whatever3 otherwise it would never
happen. The idea of possibility lies here not in the tense, but in the very
signification of the word potuissent ,· and the difference between potuissent
and possent is that the former represents the possibility as existing at some
earlier time. The idea seems to be that if it were not for the care of men
sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish, but would never
have been able to do so at any time, according lo the original ordinance of
nature]

129. 35. se esse generatos. Eos would have been more correct: but
the reflexive is used because canes, though not grammatically the subject,
is thought of as such, being implied in canunt custodia.

130. 4. ab illo aureo genere. Aratus, whom Cicero has in mind 159
here. and from whom he quotes the following verses 130 ff, says of the
golden age, v. 110: αὐτ-ως δ ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ ὁ· ἀπέκειτο mmmm, καὶ βίον
οὔπω νῆες ἀπόπροθεν ὴγίνεσκου, ἀλλὰ βόες καὶ ἄροτρα διο. ; but according to
others (as Hesiod W. ἃ D. v. 117; Virgil, Georg. Ι, 125³ Ow'd, Met. Ι,
101) the earth produced in abundance in that age all sorts of fruits spon-
