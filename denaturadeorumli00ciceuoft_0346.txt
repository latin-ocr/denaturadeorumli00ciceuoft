308 NOTES.

151. 16. apud Pacuvium, in the tragedy Medus. Aegialeus also
occurs in Diodor. IV, 45 ; Justin. XLII, 3.

151. 17. [ver-eor, quid agat ln03 “ 1 ‹lon't see what is to become of
Ino.’']

15¹· 20. lege censorla3 i.e. in the contract made by the censors
with the publicani, who undertook the collection of the Boeotian taxes.
Amphiraus had a temple at Oropus ; Trophonius at Lebadea in ssoeotia.

¹5¹· 22. Erechtheus according to the story perished in the war
against the inhabitants of Eleusis under EumolpuS, after he had slain the
latter. For this reason Cotta here couples his name with that of Codrus
who likewise died for his country. Erechthus was originally a surname of
Poseidon, like AEgeus2 it was also perpetuated in the public worship in the
title Ποσειὸῶν Ἐρεχθεῖ-ς, The temple, the Ἐρεχθεὶου, was on the Acropolis,
and the priesthood was hereditary in the family of the Butadae.

151. 31. fillaeque elus. According to the story, which contradicts
itself in many particulars‚ the daughters of Erechtheus in obedience to an
oracle gave themselves up as a sacrifice to the gods to obtain victory for
their country over its enemies3 for this they are several times cited by
Cicero as examples of sels-denying love of country. Tusc. Ι, 48, 1163
De Fin. V, 22, 62; Pro Sest. 21, 48.

151. 31. [Leonaticum. Sehoemann readsz] Leontidum,the daughters
of Leos, a mythical hero of Attica, who in time of famine, following the
direction of the oracle, suffered death to save her country. One of the*
ten tribes instituted by Clisthenes was called after Leos the φυλὴ Λεοντίς,
and the citizens of the tribe were called Λεοντῐδαι (Paus. 1, 5, 2; Ps. De-
mosth. Epitaph.,§ 29; Rg. Theokrin,§ 18), as if his name had been
Leon ,· so after the same analogy the daughters might be called Leontidcs.

151. 35. Stratonicus, an Athenian player on the cithara, famous for
his witty sayings, of which Athenaeus VIII, p. 348 f. gives some examples ;
they at last eost him his life, for a Cyprian King whom he had offended
by one of them had him poisoned. See Engel Kypros Ι, p. 496.

152. 7. Amul, an ancient form for arcus, like senati, tumulti, versi,
sumpti and other similar examples. See Schneider Gram. 11, 1,p. 471. But
according to Charisius, p. 117 Keil, where this passage is cited, Cicero
wrote Armis. Cf. Fleckeisen Krit. Misceu. (Dresd. 1864), p. 43. In the
theogony of Hesiod Ἰρις, the goddess of the rainbow, is the daughter of
Om'gams, a son of the sea, who is the cause of the wonderful phenomena
os Nature, rainbows and hau-pies ᾖε. whirlwinds, waterspouts and the like.
The name Iris is wanting in the Mss.; but nala, not natus, is found in the
greater number, and those the best. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 349.
