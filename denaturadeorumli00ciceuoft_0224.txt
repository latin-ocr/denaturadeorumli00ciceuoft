196 NOTES.

44. 9. Persaeus was not only a disciple but fellow-eountryman of
Zeno.

44. ιο. a quibus . . . esset inventa. Of course Persaeus did not
explain the existence of all the gods in this way, but only of some of them,
as Bacchus, Ceres, Aesculapius. See ΙΙ, 24, 62.

44. 11. ipsasque res utiles. See 11, 23, 60. 62; and 31, 80.

44. 13. Quo . . . quam . . . A sort of ὲπεξὴγησις where the idea, which
is referred to by the relative as contained in the foregoing, is afterwards
reasserted in a different and more definite form. Comp. De Fin. 1, 6:
ait enim declinare atomos sine causa ,· quo nihil turpius physico, quam
fieri sine causa quidquam dicere ,· where Madvig gives further examples.
Yerr. IV, 35, 77; Orat. I, 37, 169. The Greeks often use the same form
of sentence. See Matthiae, Gr. Gr. ξ 450, 2 and Rem. 2.

44. 16. Chrysippus of Soli in Cilicia (nc. 280-206)‚ disciple and
successor of Cleanthes, very active as a teacher and author, and regarded
as the one who really completed the Stoic system ; see the verse in Diog. ’
L. VII, 183: εὶ μὴ >dp ὴν Χρὺσιππος, οὐκ ἀν ἦν Στοά, Hence the trausi-
tion to him is especially marked by iam vera.

44. 19. [cogitatione posse depingere. Cicero often uses cogitatio
for our “ fancy,’' “ imagination,’⁷ the genus for the species, there being no
exactly corresponding word in Latin. Mil. 29, 79: fingite animis . .
liberae sunt enim nostrate cogitationes et quae volunt sic intuentur, ut ea
cernimus, quae ridemus . . . fingite cogitatione imaginem huius conditio-
nis meae. Nagclsb. ξ 8, 1.]

44. 20. in ratione . . . et . . . mente. The copula adds a more spe-
cial to a general expression. The soul of the universe is referred to. Τὴν
φρένα πάντων καὶ , , , Ῡό) 01¹ καὶ τὴν roi· ὓλην ψυχήν is the expression in the
passage relating to Chrysippus of the Herculanean fragment, referred to
in Introduction, p. 15.

44. 22. eius animi fusionem universam, for eius animum ubique
fusum .· the abstract for the concrete. This is clearly only another expres-
sion fot the soul of the universe.

44. 22. eius ipsius principatum. Again the same thing differently
expressed. For the subject· -matter comp 11, 11, 29.

44. 24. fatalem. .necessitatem ἃς. The εἱμαρμένη (c. 20, 55),
the eternal law, by the force of which events succeed one another in a
continuous chain of cause and effect.

44. 25. ignem . . . ot . . . aethera. The special expression added to
the general one, which might, if used alone, suggest only the common
earthly fire. Comp. note to ΙΙ, 15, 41 3 and for et Hand Turseli. 11, p. 477.

44. 26. quae natura fluerent atque manarent. fluant, manent
