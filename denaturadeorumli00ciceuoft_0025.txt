IN'I'RODUCTION. 1 5

We cannot say with certainty who this predecessor was: but
many reasons, which need not be given here in detail, point to the
Rhodian Posidonius, who is spoken of in the note to l. 3. 6. and
who, as Cicero says in that passage, had been his teachcr: and
doubtless the teacher of Balbus also. since Cotta 1. 44, 123, calls him
familiare& omnium nostrum. His work περὶ θεῶν was one of con-
siderable extent: Diogenes Laertius, Vll, 138, cites the thirteenth
book ; so that Cicero gave only a short extract. It is possible. though
we have no evidence. that he also made use of other Stoic writings.
All that he cites from Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus and Panaetius.
even if he had ever read thern, he might have found in Posidonius:
and even what he says in 11, 34 of the sphere of Posidonius could
have been found in the same author. He however differs from him
in some particulam, as for example the size of the moon, 11, 40, 103:
and the whole astronomical part 0f§ 104 appears to have been
worked up independently. Of course the etymologies of the Latin
names of the gods, 11. 26, 27, as well as the examples from Roman
history are Cicero's own, given perhaps in place of others used by
Posidonius.¹ Besides in 1, 44, 123 he himself cites the fifth book of
Posidonius De Mztura Deorum.

It has been conjectured that Cicero took his account os the
Epicurean doctrine froin a work of the Epicurean Phaedrus περὶ
’ θεῶν which he requests the loan of in a letter to Atticus (XIII.
39) ²3 and as we find among the fragments of an Epicurean theologi-
cal treatise discovered at Herculaneum a portion with which the
exposition of Cicero in the first book, c. 15. 39—41‚ though much
shorter‚ yet in the main coincides: the conclusion has been drawn
that those fragments were a part of this treatise of Phaedrus-¹ But
it is now conceded that the fragments of Herculaneum, which were
published subsequently in the Herculanensium collectio altera, N eap.
1862, torn. 11, belonged rather to a treatise of Philodemus περὶ
εὐσεβείας. It is very probable that Cicero made use of this

seems open to no doubt. Δ
