the same subject, one os which is sometimes opposed to the other ; “the
same person not only does this, but he also does that”,· or “ although he
does this, he still does that.‘']

50. 18. ad veritatem plane, “entirely according to truth,'‘ i.e. as ab·
solute truth would require ; so that I should be convinced of it by positive
proos, non opinione, not by an opinion I had been persuaded to adopt.

63 5ο. 29. Diagoras of Melos, one os the CycladeS‚ contemporary of
Democritus, Protagoras and Socrates. IIe was also a lyric poet, and some
verses os his poems which still remain breathe a thoroughly religious
feeling. His atheism‚ which is repeatedly alluded to, is perhaps to be
attributed to error in scientific speculations‚ due to the influence of Demo-
critus, whose disciple he is said to have been, and os Protagoras ; although
other reasons are alleged sor it. See Meier in the Encyclopaedia os Ersch
and Gruber.

50. 30. Theodorus of Cyrene, under Ptolemaeus Lagi, denied not
only the existence of the gods but also the truth os our moral perceptions,
which he considered as only devised to keep the multitude in check. See
Diog. L. 11, 99.

5ο. 31· Protagoras. See note to c. 12, 29.

50. 33. neque ut sint neque ut non sint. The exact words of Pro—
tagoras are preserved in Diog. L. lx, 51 : περὶ μὲν θεῶν οὐκ ἔχω εἰδέναι ow
ὠς εἰσὶν οὐθ’ ὡς οὐκ εἰσίν. Sometimes they are given in a somewhat different
shape. See Frey, Quaest. Protag.‚ p. 98. Cicero’s translation word for
word violates the Latin usage. Moreover according to Diog. 54 the ac-
cuser of Protagoras was Pythodorus, one of the four hundred (in the year
411); and if the accusation was brought at that time, it may be assumed
that the men, who were then in power, being opposed to the unbridled
democracy, felt that they ought not to tolerate such free-thinking doc-
trines as Protagoras prcached. In other cases the Athenians were as a
rule very tolerant in regar-d to theoretical views, and interfered to punish
only in those cases, where the existence of the gods was expressly denied,
or when the existing institutions and customs were attacked and violated.
