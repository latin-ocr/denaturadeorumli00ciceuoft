108. 10. Aristoteles. No passage corresponding to that quoted in 95
the text is found in the extant writings of Aristotle ς yet Sext. limp. IX, 22
cites the following passage of his: θεασάμενοι γὰρ μεθ’ ἡμέραν μὲν isium
περιπολοῦντα, νύκτωρ δὲ τὴν εὖτακτον τῶν ἀλλων ἀστέρων κίνησιν, ἐνόμισαν
εἷναί τινα θεὸν τὸν τῆς τοιαῦτης κινήσεως καὶ εὐταξίας αἱτιον. It was proba-
bly from the dialogue περὶ φιλοσοφίας mentioned above Ι, 13, 333 11, 15,
42. 44.

108. 32. quae cum viderent. [Schoemann reads haec for quae, and
says] the Mss. all have quae cum viderent. If Cicero really wrote thus,
he must in his haste have lost sight of the construction os the sentence,
which is in itself not impossible. It is still quite as probable that he wrote
neither lzaec nor quae, and that the words cum viderent went with immu-
tabilis cursus, and that the conclusion os the sentence commenced with
profecto. That is Madvig's opinion. [Miiller prefers to suppose that at
the end osso long a passage Cicero changed the construction and wrote
quae than that the copyists changed lzaec into quae, or themselves interpo-
lated the quae. Baiter ΙΙ brackets the quae]

108. 35. quondam eruptione Aetnaeorum ignium. It is impos-39}
sible to ascertain which os the various eruptions of AEtna is here alluded to;
the notices of the ancients in regard to them are collected by Cluver. Sicil.
Ant. 1, 8, p. 104 ff.

109. 15. horas, i.e. horarium or horologium. It would be difficult to 97
find other examples of lzoras in this signification, except perhaps in the
expression ad lzoras mittere, Cic. Brut. c. 54, 200 2 “to send some one to
look at the clock''; Petron. c. 71: horas inspicere. The words machi-
natione quadam show that a hydraulic clock is alluded to.

109. 24. ipsam sese nutibus suis conglobata3 gathered into theffg
shape osa ball by reason of the tendency of all its parts towards the cen-
tre. Comp. c. 45, 116: omnibus eius partibus in medium vergentibus.
The same explanation of the spherical form is often found also in other
places, as eg. in Arist. De Caelo ΙΙ, c. 14. Others derived it from the revo-
lution of the heavens around the earth3 Plin. H. N. ΙΙ, 64: immensum
eius globum in formam orbis assidua circa eum mundi volubilitate cogente.
Comp. Bake on Cleomed., p. 276, and Ideler on Arist. Meteor. Ι, p. 497.

109. 26. insatiabili varietate, i.e. quae numquam nos satiat, that
never causes satiety and annoyance. So c. 62, 155: insatiabilior species,-
Fr. Hortens. Orell. IV, 2, p. 482 : caeli signorum admirabilem ordinem in-
sanabilemque pulchritudinem magis spectat. Other examples of adjectives
of this termination in active signification are animabilis above c. 36, 91 [in
