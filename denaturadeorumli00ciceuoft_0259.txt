of the most remote countries.”] —The following anapaestic verses are per·
haps taken stom the Philoctetus of Attius, and refer to the mysteries of
the Cabiri at Lemnos. Probably the verses cited by Varro L. L. vn, 11

went before :
Lemnia praesto

littora rara et celsa Cabirum
delubra tenes, mysteria queis
pristina castis concepta sacris.

67. 26. Quibus explicatis διο. ΤΙιειῐ is, the deeds and experiences
of the gods, set forth in the myster-ies, have an allegorical signification?
if you bring them down to their true meaning (ad rationem revocatis),
you recognize in the gods the powers of nature personified‚ and in their
actions and experiences natural events. This was the view of thinking
minds; but we cannot believe that the priests themselves gave explana·
tions of that sort to those initiated in the mysteries.—Comp. besides the
similar expressions in regard to the allegorical interpretations of the Stoics

67. 29. hortulos suos inrigavit, alluding to the garden in which ’ἐξ

Epicurus lived. See note on 33, 93.

67. 29. nutare, to waver, have no settled, tenable opinion. Comp.
De Fin. 11, 2, 6: qunc aulem dico ipsum Epicurum nescire (quid sit
voluptas) in eoque nutare.

67. 30. Tum enim censet . . . So sar as we can ascertain the theo-
logical views of Democritus, he held first the existence of a divine sub-
stance pervading the whole universe, consisting of special atoms of the
most subtle constitution. This is the θεία οὐσία in Clem. Alex. Strom. V,
5 88, p. 698 Pott.‚ and the κόσμου ψυχή in Plutarch Plac. Phil. I, 7. From
this substance proceed not only the individual gods but also the souls of
living beings, which by breathing constantly receive as nourishment par·
ticles of this same substance which pervades the air. Arist.⁸ De Resp. c. 4.
It is this substance doubtless which Cicero here means by principia mentis,
and which above also c. 12, 29 he intends by natura quae imagines sundal.
Fo'r from this proceed the divine forms called εῖδωλα on account of their
subtle, etherial constitution quite different from the coarser corporeal form:
ὁὺσφθαρτα μέν, οὑκ ἄφθαρτα δέ. καὶ τοίη-ων τὰ μὲν εἶναι ἀ) αθοττοιά, τὰ
δὲ κακοποιὰ. Sext. Emp.1x‚ 19, p. 553. These are Cicero's animantes
imagines, quae vel prodesse nobis soleant vel nocere ‚· and likewise without
doubt the imagines divinitate praeditae mentioned in the beginning of the
passage. But the last—mentioned ingentes imag-ines, which embrace the
whole universe from without, are not alluded to in this shape by any other
author, and probably are the result of a misunderstanding.
