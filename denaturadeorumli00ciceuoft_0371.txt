APPENDIX. 331

In the last part os the passage the words mentem intentam infixamque
nostram intelltgmtiam capere are evidently to be understood not os the
simple contemplation or perception by the mens, but rather os the process
os reasoning which follows, examines and searches for the true purport of
our perceptions. Perception alone is only receptive and can naturally give
only the species deorum, as Cotta (ξ 107) rightly remarks3 but a percep-
tion that is only receptive and passive is not enough sor the human mind;
it is thereby roused to an individual activity. This is again of two kinds :
first, so to speak, a cursory one, and the ideas which come from it spon-
taneously are very properly called προλήψεις, notiones anlicz'palae, ante-
ceplae inſsmnationes (ξ 43). If they are sometimes called intellegentiae,
this is hardly done without an epithet to denote their nature, such as in-
choatae, adumbratae, obscurae, Cic. De Leg. Ι, 9, 25 ; 10, 30 ; 22, 59 (comp.
on De Offie. 111, 10, 76); in reality they are only opiniones (ξ 45); they
cannot become intellegentia but through more exact investigation and
rational foundation which the mind aims at while it is busy with them.
This is denoted by the Greek ἐπιβάλλειν, ἐπιβολὴ (Schneider ad Epicur,
Physic., p. 65), and Cicero expresses it by animus se iniciens et intendens,
or, as in our passage, mens intenta infixaque.

Now if the intellegentia thus gained is spoken of as one quae sit et
beata natura ct aelerna it is plainly nonsense; and this is generally ac-
knowledged. The emendation 1 (Prof. Sch.) proposed in my Opusc.
Acad. IV, 347 I called paullo obscurior‚· but it is not so obscure that it
might not be understood with a little thought. Bake’s quam sit ea beata
natura et aelerna (Mnemosyn. II, p. 415) may be easier so far as the Mss.
are concerned; but one of the desenders of this reading has not over-
looked the fact that quam cannot possibly be taken of the measure or
degree of happiness and immortality os the gods. He has recourse there-
fore to the assumption that the difficulty of the passage results from a rather
stupid misunderstanding on the partos Cicero. He thinks Cicero found
in the Greek original that he was translating ὡς, which there had the
force of ὃτι corresponding to “ that'' introducing a sentence ς and that he
erroneously took this sor the adverb equivalent to quantum or quantopere.
If Cicero had found ὡς in the original, he would have translated it by ut, as
he did in the phrase of Protagoras in c. 23, 63.

On the law of Isonomy cited by Velleius in ξ 5ο as an argument sor the
happiness and immortality of the gods I have expressed my doubts on p. 24.
Is Epicurus and the greater part of his followers did not make use os this
law, it remains to inquire what other argument they did advance. There
are no express data on this point and we can only form conjectures. We
