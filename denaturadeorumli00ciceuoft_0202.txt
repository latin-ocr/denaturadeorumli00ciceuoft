1 76 NOTES.

visum sor the Greek φαντασία, as in Acad. 1, 11, 40 and 11, 6, 18, and this
is one reason why Heindorf brackets this whole sentence; Baiter does
the same.]—The construction at the end of the sentence is not quite
regular. It would be more correct were it either quac . . . sapientis vitam
rqgcrcnl or quihus . . . sapientis vila lugeretur. As it is, quae ‹lemm-
quam can only be equivalent to ct quamquam hacc, and one would rather
expect iis sapientis vitam rugi, so that both clauses, multa csse probabilia
and iis . . . regi connected by quae (sor et llaec), would depend on exstitit.
But such irregularity is easily explained and excused.

36. ιι. perciperentur. This expression, like comprehendere with
which it is osten coupled, especially in the Lucullus, denotes a perseetly
certain and undoubted knowledge and comprehension os an object, the
ἀσφαλὴς καὶ βεβαία καὶ &sarathi-og· κατάληψις of the Stoics.

3615- omnes, qui . . ‚indit-ent, z'.e. all those who pronounce a

distinct judgment3 the Dogmatics in contradistinction to the Academics ,

who resrained froin any such judgment: nullam rem aperte iudicant,
ξ 11; comp. 111, 40, 95: ca quae ‹lllgl’ulari disserere malui quam iudi-
care. [But why are the Dogmatics summoned rather than any others?
and in point of sact the Aeademie bears a most important part in the
dialogue. The natural meaning of qui . . . iudicent would seem to be “to
consider the sententias philosophorum in medio positas and judge which of
them are truc ”3 iudicare quac sit carum vcra can hardly mean “to hold
a clear opinion ou the question in general ”; carum must refer to senlen-
ti11s preceding. The sentence seems to be rather an awkward appeal to
all the world, in the same vein as the quotation from Caecilius just below]

36. 18. (est) in Synephebis. ‘l‘he vei-b is wanting in the Mss. Syn-
ephebi was the title of afthula palliam os Caecilius Statius, a younger
contemporary of Plautus. The Greek original was by Menander.—-The
first two of the verses cited are regular trochaic tetrameters; the other two
were doubtlcss of the same metre, but, whether by the sault of Cicero or
that of the copyists‚ have gotten into confusion. [nou vult; nevolt
Schoemann, Baiter I and ΙΙ.]

36. 29. auspiciis, qtiibus nos praesumus. Cicero had been a
member of the college os Augurs since the year 700 of the city, the 54th
of his age. 11e also wrote a book De .-1ugm‘i1's‚ probably aster the De Nat.
Dcor. and De Diw‘n. See the fragments in Orelli lv, 2, p. 478.

37. 3. C. Cottam3 see Introduction, p. 17.

37. 4. feriis Latinis. The ancient feast os the Latin Consederation
was annually celebrated on the Alban Mount‚ the Roman consuls presiding,
even long aster the confederation had ceased to exist. lt did not take
