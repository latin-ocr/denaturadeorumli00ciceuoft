have written: quid est, cuius, cum principium aliquod sil, nillil sil exire-
mum ,Ρ On this form of sentence in general see below note to c. 9, 23.
38. 29. sl est [eadem] scil. ac Platonicus deus. The traditional read·
ing, Pronoea vero si vestra est, eadem requiro gives no adequate sense,
but has found some defendens.
38. 32. mortalem mundum. Comp. note to 11, 46, 118.

38. 33. Ab utroque, i.e. a le, Lucili, et a Platona—For the matter ἐξ

itself see Lucret. V, 169 ff.

38. 34. exstiterint: i.e. prodierint ad aedificandum.

39. 2. nam fateor etc. Comp. Plat. Timae.‚ p. 39 E: ἡμέρας γὰρ καὶ
νίνκτας καὶ μῆνας καὶ ἐνιαυτοὺς οὐκ ὂντας πρὶν οὐρανὸν γενέσθαι, τότε ἅμα
ἐκείνῳ ξυνισταμὲνῳ τὴν γένεσιν αὐτῶν μηχανᾶται (ὁ δημιουργός) ταῦτα δὲ
πάντα μέρη χρόνου. Saeculum, according to Censorin. d. die nat. c. 17,
spatium vilae humanae longissimum, partu et morte definitum. Origi-
nally therefore the span of life; later a definite period of a hundred or
a hundred and ten years ; sometimes too a longer period in general of no
precise limits.

39. 3. sed fuit . . .intellegi (non) potest. The connection of
thought, misunderstood by many, is as follows: Before the creation of the
world and the heavenly bodies there was an eternity without beginning or
division into periods ; but of its duration (lit. of what sort it was in respect
to duration, spatio) we can have no conception. We can conceive only
measurable and limited time ; but this was a thing impossible before the
heavenly bodies existed, by whose movements time is measured and di-
vided.— The negation before polest is indispensable. Comp. Arist. Phys.

Ι, p. 79, Orelli.

39. 6. ut fuerit. We should expect ul fuisse intellegamus ,· the ab·
breviated form of expression is not unfrequent. Comp. De Fin. I, 5, 14:
adduci vix possum, ut ea tibi non vera videantur, sor ut ea tibi vera esse
non credam. De Legg. ΙΙΙ, 15, 33: ego in isla sum sententia, nihil ut
suerit in suffragiis voce melius, for utsuisse putem ,· more examples of the
sort where a consequence only conceived is expressed precisely as an
actual. one may be seen in Madvig's note to the above passage De Fin.,
and Haase notes to Reisig's Vorlesungen, p. 557. Comp. also below c. 27,
75 and 34, 95. [The two examples cited by Prof. Schoemann are quite
dissimilar. After adduci there is plainly an ellipsis as it is commonly
explained. But with in ista sententia sum the explanation does not hold.
1 am not of the opinion that Ι think a thing is so, 1 am of the opinion that
it is so. So in Tusc. V, 41, 119: quorum ea sententia est ul virtus per se
