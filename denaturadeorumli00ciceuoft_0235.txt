BOOK I.—C}{AP. XXIII, XXIV, §§ 62-66. 207

Quo plebiscito decreta a senatu est consuli quaestio Cn. Caepioni (ann.
613); prosc-ctus in exilium Tubulus statim, nec respondere ausum erat
enim rcs aperla.” Cic. De Fin. 11, 16, 54.

51. 6. Lupus. Perhaps L. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, who was con·
sul in the year 579. That he was severely handled by the satirist Lucilius
is shown by Horace Sat. II, 1, 68; and Pers. 1, 1143 of the reason noth-
ing is known.

51. 6. Carbo (C. Papirius), the famous demagogue, and doubtless
the object of attack on the part of the satirist for his demagogical doings.

51. 6. Neptuni filius is equivalent to homo saevus et immanis accord-
ing to Gellius, N. A. XV, 21, in allusion to Polyphemus, Cercyo, Seiron,
the Laestrygones and similar monsters which the myth spoke of as sprung
from Neptune. The aut of the Mss. is probably not genuine and the
expression denotes no other than Carbo 3 for the idea, that the reference
is to some mythical hero, perhaps CercyQ only deserves to be mentioned
as a curiosity.

51. 14. atomorum . . . licentia, on account of the arbitrary declina- 65
tio atomorum, as Epicurus held it. See c. 25, 69.

51. 14. quodcumque in solum venit, “whatever comes into your
minds.’' The origin of the expression is obscure. See Wolf Litt. Anal.
IV! 347 ff·

51. 15. Quae primum nullae sunt, i.e. the atoms. The primum
leads one to expect a second proposition in regard to the atoms, which
however is wanting; it is clear too that the next sentence does not, as the
enim suggests, give a reason for the non-existence of the atoms. The pas-
sage is incomplete3 and the thought may be conjecturally supplemented
partly from Cicero himself (Acad. 1, 7, 27), as follows: quae primum
nullae sunt,· nihil est enim [in rerum natura minimum, quod dividi
nequeo& deinde, ut sint, moveri per inane non possunt, siquidem id dicis
inane] quod vacet corpore ,· corporibus autem omnis obsidetur locus.
Comp. Schoemann Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 287. —Epicurus assumed as the
beginning of all things an empty space and atoms moving therein. Diog.
L. X, 40; and especially Lucret. 1, 500 ff. Other philosophers denied
entirely the existence of an empty space. Stobaeus Ecl. 1, 19; Plut.
Plac. Phil. 1, 18.

5¹- 18. oracula fundo. See note to c. 16, 42. 2⁶4}

51. 20. flagitia for opiniones flagitiosas, contemptu et vituperatione
dignas. So also III, 38, 91. After the statement of these opinions the
thread of the discourse is resumed by hanc tu opinionem.

51. 20. [Democriti. See c. 43, 120 and note]
