— While the sun revolves around the earth from East to West 365 times
and a fraction, it moves backward along the ecliptic through the twelve
signs from West to East5 sometimes it approaches nearer to our orbis ter-
rarum while moving up to the sign of the Cancer in the North, sometimes
it goes farther from it while moving downward to the sign of Capricorn.
—The calculation of the tropical solat year of 363} days is moreover much
older than the introduction among the Romans of the Julian year which
was based upon it.

50 94. 2. solis annuos eur-sus, i.e. the moon makes in a month the pas-
sage through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, which the sun completes in a

ΞΡ 94. ιι. ear-um quinque stellarum. It is well known that the

ancieuts were acquainted with only live, or, counting the sun and moon,

with seven planets. Yet many people surmised that there might be sev-

eral others invisible for their feeble light. Senec. Nat. Qu. VII, 13, 1.

94. 13. progressus et regressus. The apparent motions os the
planets are sometimes forward and sometimes backward, called nowadays
the direct and the retrograde motions.

94. 15. tum adeunt, tum recedunt. This, like antecedendo et re-
tardando ξ 52, is to he taken in reference to the sun. All the planets‚ as
well as the sun, move through the Zodiac, at times they are nearer, at
times farther from the sun; sometimes they go before, sometimes after
it. Of course all this is to be understood os their apparent, not their real
motion.
