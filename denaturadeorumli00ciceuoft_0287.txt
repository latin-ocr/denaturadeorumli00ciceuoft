BOOK 11.—C}{A1·. XXIV, XXV, §§ 62—65. 255

98. 12. spatiorum ac temporum. The second word serves to σεχ-25

plain the first. If there were room here there would be much to say
against the explanation given in the text os the name and idea of Kronos,
common as it was, if not universal, among those who in ancient times took
the stories of the gods as allegories. Cotta refutes, as they desen-e, in 111,
24, 62 the etymology of Saturnus and most of those which follow. A more
probable one, Saturnus ιι salu, is given by Varro L. L., V, 64. The older
form of the name was Sassturnus, i.e. Sailurnus, which would explain too
the length of the first syllable in Saturnus. See Ritschl De Fictil. Litt.
(Berolin, 1853), p. 7 ff. Others derive this name from the Sanscrit, from
Savz'tar‚ which denotes the “ begetter,‘’ and was also an epithet of the sun.
So Schweizer in the Zeitsch. sur Vergleich. Sprachwiss. IV, 68.

98. 18. ut eum alligaret, because the lapse of time in a certain
sense depends on the measure of time given by the heavenly bodies, by
which the divisions of time, years, months and days are tixed. —The sud-
den change of subject is allowable, as there was no danger of confusion.
Similar examples in &Vopken's Lectt. Tullian.‚ p. 264.

98. 19. luppiter . . . iuvans pater. Against this see note c. 2, 4.
Yet the derivation here given by Cicero was a very natural one and espe-
cially commended itself to the religious feeling of the ancients on the same
ground that he suggests for their placing optumus before maxumus. Comp.
Or. pro Dom. c. 57, 144: quesn propter beneficia P. R. optumum, propter
vim maxumum nominavit. — conversis casibus Ξ obliquis casibus.
[luppiter stands without a subject, as the clause a poclis . . . dicitur men-
tions only an incidental circumstance ; at lzunc (gitur, l. 39, the thread is
again taken up, but with the construction changed. So Miiller explains
the text; commonly Iuppiter is taken as subject of dicitur, l. 21, and lzunc
igitur Ennius begins a new sentence. Miiller's text gives the full force to
the igitur]

98. 29. exsecrabor in the second verse from Ennius appears to be used 65
for consecrabo, a usage which, though no other example of it is known, does
not contradict the etymology and the original meaning based on it, namely,
the separating of something from the number of other things as sacrum
(consecrated to the deity). Heindorf ’s explanation is far less probable ;
he takes exsecrabor hoc quod lucet for iram caeli imprecabor, and refers
cui to some person on whom the speaker desires the anger of heaven to
fall.-The verses of Euripides, it is uncertain from what play, perhaps
from the Antiope, are found in Stobae. Ecl. I, 3, 2 ; Lucian, Iup. Trag. 41,
and others as follows: ὁρᾷς τὸν ὑψοῦ τόνδ’ ᾶπειρον αἰθέρα, καὶ ὶῆυ πέριξ
ἔχονθ’ ὑγραῖς ἑν ἀγκάλαις · τοῦτον νόμιζε Ζῆνα, τόνδ’ ἡγοῦ θεόν, The transla-
tion is probably Cicero‘s own—breviter, which precedes in the Mss.‚
must either be changed to graviter or cancelled.
