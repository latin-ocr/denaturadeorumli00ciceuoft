IN'I'RODUC'I'ION. 1 Ι

Zeus‚¹ and partly because these gods according to the Stoic explana-
tions were no persons, but things, relations, capacitieS‚ &0²3 hence
the Stoics have been attacked as being atheists. Ilut these two
reproaches are easily seen to neutralize each other; sor if these gods
were sor the Stoics only things, relations and capacities‚ and if the}¹
were only called gods by way of personification‚ the Stoics could
not be blamed for considering them mortal ς they could not of course
exist longer than the world. The other reproach could only reason-
ably be made by those persons who acquitted the Stoics of the
second (namely that the gods were only to be held as such by a
figure of speech), while they recognized their belief in the person—
ality of the gods. And in reality it is difficult to see why the Stoics‚
if not all, at least some or perhaps many of them might not have
held that belief. The consistency of the system certainly in no wise
sorbade their acknowledging the existence of superhuman beings
who, as servants and helpers of the supreme god, presided over the
world and human life in various spheres and relations: ancl thus
they could always without hesitation assent to the popular saith
which offered them such deities. It was a contradiction with the
popular saith that they conceived them to be mortal‚ but not one
worthy of blame. The popular saith was not shocked at the idea of
gods that had had a beginning: and if in spite of this it held such
gods as immortal‚ the Stoics were on the other hand more consis-
tent3 and the whole repmach, carefully examined, amounts to no
more than this, that, since immortality is necessarily included 1'n the
idea of the deity, their gods, as not being immortal‚ were really no
gods, but only superhuman, demonic beings ε but on the other
hand as a compensation for this they conceived the one supreme
God ofa majesty truly divine.

A third reproach, which is often made against the Stoics‚ is that
they degraded the gods by teaching that man owed to them only
inferior endowments and external goods. while he could attain to
wisdom and virtue by himself alone.³ This reproach too has no
sense except we concede that the gods were sor the Stoics real
