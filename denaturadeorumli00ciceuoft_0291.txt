100. 31. Sed tamen . . . The connection is: Although these sables 71
are stupid affairs and we discard them altogether, we are not on this
account to reject the popular deities too ; only we must have the right idea
os them.
101. 6. superstitiosi. It is quite clear that the derivation os the 72
word given in the text deserves no consideration; nor any more the vari· or,·'¹·.2“.1f⁵

Deutsche Mythol. ΙΙ, p. 1059: “superstitio, from superum, denotes in the 3( v ,ρ
case of individual men a continued persistence in opinions which the ῃ ¹ d

101. 9. religiosi a relegendo. See note Ι, 2, 3. The verse cited by ⁶⁰ mmm
Gellius IV, 9: redigentem le oportet esse, relzgriosus ne fuas (for that is the
true reading), cannot be held to warrant the derivation given in the text by
Cicero, as relzgrens is not a current word, but one manufactured by the poet
to support that derivation. Competent scholars have long thought that no
grammatical objection lies against the derivation from rehgare, especially
when it is considered that there was an old form lngre sor ligare. Comp.
Ebel in the Zeitsch. f. vgl. Sprachk. IV, p. 449.
101. 12. [superstitioso and religioso here designate merely the
words superstitiosus and religiosus ,· but in accordance with the more usual
Latin usage are taken into the sentence and put in the ablative as though
they were used in their actual meaning. See Nagelshach Lat. Styl.

101. 24. praecise dieitur, “is an elliptical expression,'’ in which
something is omitted whichffnust be mentally supplied. Comp. Ad Herenn.
IV, 30, 31: praecisio est cum, dictis quibusdam, reliquum relinquitur
inchoatum in auditoris iudicio.

101. 25. Areopagi. In Cicero’s time the Areopagus had, as the eoun- 74
cil of state, a far more extended sphere and more important influence on
public affairs than in the flourishing period of Athens, when, especially after
Pericles, its competence was very limited. Comp. Ahrens de Athen. statu

Areopag und die Epheten, p. 314.

101. 32. unum . . . limatum, i.e. praeter ceteros or in paucis lima-
tum. It is not alone with superlatives that unus serves to strengthen the
expression. Comp. Lucret. VI, 1229: illud in lzzs rebus miserandum et
magnopere unum aerumnabile erat: Horat. Sat.1, 10, 40: potes . co-
