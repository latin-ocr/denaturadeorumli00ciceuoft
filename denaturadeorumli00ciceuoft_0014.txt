4 DE NATURA DEORUM.

prescribed certain symbolic acts which were quite consistent with
different conceptions os the gods. and might be understood and ex-
plained by different persons in different ways3 so that any one.
though not sharing in the prevailing belief, or even though quite
breaking loose from it in his philosophical speculamus, might still
have adhered to the common ritual so as to avoid collision with the
people or priesthood. XVhen therefore Xenophanes declared that
man had only opinions, but no positive knowledge in regard to the
gods, no fault was found with him, because he did not thereby deny
their existence3 still less when he rejected the sables of the gods
given by Homer, Hesiod, and other poets, pronouncing them ridicu—
lous, undignified. and in part blasphemous. We are not to suppose
that the priests or the people ever regarded these fables as anything
more than entertaining stories or perhaps picturesque allegories. not
to be taken literally; they did not consider them as real historiesv
which the poets had received by revelation and which it was sinsul
not to believe.¹ Undoubteclly the sables had a real influence upon‘
the belief of the multitude, and gave rise to very unworthy and per-
verted conceptions of the gods, which were only too easily taken up
and held fast when the (leities were imagined to be like men. The
more clear-thinking minds however, though not themselves sharing
these anthropomorphic conceptions‚ doubtless saw very well the use-
lessness of attempting to convince the people of their error. and·
were satisfied if they could succeed in clearing them of all the
attendant lowness and immorality. 'We have, it is true, no definite
information of the attitude of the older philosophers in this matter3
but all that we know isquite in harmony with the view here ad-
vanced. Although Xenophanes for example and Parmenides recog-
nized only one true god, and did not consider the popular deities as
gods at all in the real sense, but only as something between god and
man, they yet accommodated their language to the common usage,
and designated them also as gods.² We have express evidence too

¹ particular sables might certainly sor some reason or other be held in espe-
cial veneration among the people, so that any one who denied them passed
among believers for a godless free-thinker. Sec Lucian. Philops. c. 3. But
except sor this the phrase, 5112).st φείδονται ἀοιδοί, had even become proverbial.
