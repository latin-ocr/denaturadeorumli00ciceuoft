the waves before him. —V. 5, interruptum . . . nimbum, a breaking
rain cloud. —dum . . . (lum seem anciently to have been equivalent to
tum . . . tum. Catullus LXII, 45, says sic virgo dum intacta manet, dum
cara suis cst sor cum . . . tum (or sor dum . . . usque eo, as Quintil. IX, 3,
16 takes it). Comp. Savelsberg in the N. Rhein. Mus. XXVI, p. 135. But
Drakenborch on Livy XL, 42, 7, and Arntzen on Aurel. Vict. 89, show that
dum and tum are osten confounded by the copyists. — V. 10, Triton, the
sea god, subject to 'Neptune (see Ι, 28, 78), who presided especially over
streamS. -- In the last verse perhaps erigit should be the reading for eruit,
as Lachmann Lucret., p. 346 thinks.

107. 4. in merila parte mundi. Comp. c. 39, 98. This was notpgll3
only the opinion of the Stoics, but was of old the prevailing view of the
majority os people; expressly testitied to by Thales (Plut. Plac. Phil. ΙΙΙ,
11), Anaximander (Diog. L. 11, 1), Pythagoras (Id. VIII, 25), Leucippus
(IX, 30), Diogenes of Apollonia (IX, 52) and others.

107. 5. [animali. This seems to be the true reading, and is that of
Baiter in both editions. Cicero is here giving only a simple definition of
air, as in N. D. ΙΙΙ, 14, 34: simplex est nalura animantis, ut vel terrena
vel ignea vel animalis vel umida ,· and Tuse. I, 17, 40: . . . reliquae duae
partes, una ignea, altera animalis ,· Tusc. I, 18, 42: spirabilem, id est
animalem. Prof. Schoemann retains animabili of the Mss. and gives the
following note]: animabili, “animating‚'' “vivifying⁷’; because, as is
said c. 45, 117, vitalem et salutarem spiritum praebet animanlibus. The
adjectives in -bilis often have an active meaning. See below note c. 39, 98.

107. 6. perceptum . . . usu; understood, comprehended in conse-
quence os continual use. Comp. De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 2, 5; rhetorica, dialectica,
grammatica, geometria, musica, quamquam Latine ea dici poterant, tamen,
quoniam usu percepta sunt, nostra ducamus. Quintil. V, 12, 1: vel ab
aliis tradita vel usu percepta. Comp. above I, 14, 36: usitatas perceptas-
que notiones.—-Cicero also derives α’ἑν from the Greek in Acad. I, 7, 26.
The older Romans said spiritus or caelum. See Plin. H. N. II, 5 ι spiritus,
quem Graeci nostrique eodem vocabulo a‘era appellant ,· ib. c. 38: namque
et hoc caelum appellavere maiores, quod alio nomine a?ra‚· Lucret. IV,
133: caelum qui dicitur a'e'r. —It is very uncertain whether the verses are
quoted srorn the Dulorestes of Pacuvius. Comp. Jahn. in Hermes II,
p. 230.
