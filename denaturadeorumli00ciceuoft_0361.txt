frages, we should arrive at the conclusion that the most and the best rather
agreed with the Stoic (11, 66), and that the sort of sels-conlident reliance
on one's own strength and goodness which thinks to get on without the
help os the deity was an illusion that became more and more general aster
the time os the sophistS, but was never the prevailing view os really classi-
cal antiquity. Of course it was understood that even the gads do not
make a man virtuous without or against his will ; he must meet them half
way, he must desire their aid and have the will on his part to cooperate
in the work of virtue. In this sense the poet says: ἑν μέσῳ κειται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ‹hophu-01( δίκην ὁσίαν (in Clem. Alex. Strom. V, 12, 137) ς and this
is the idea of Plato Rep. X. 617 E: ἀρετὰ ἀδέσποτον, ἢν τιμῶν καὶ ἀτιμάζων
πλέον καὶ ἐλαττου αὐτῆς ἕκαστος ἕξει · αἰτία ἑλομένου, θεὸς ἁι·αί.·ιος; a passage
which has been wrongly cited by some commentators os Cicero as agreeing
with the views of Cotta.

164. 33. Herculi decumam vovit3 a reference to the ost-mentioned 88
. Roman custom of consecrating the tenth of one's gain to Hercules. See
Heindorf on Horace Sat. 11, 6, 103 Jahn on Persius ΙΙ, 11.

164. 35. Pythagoras. The story is told of several persons ς accord-
ing to Diog. Laert. VIII, 12 the proposition discovered was the so-called
problem of Pythagoras or magister matheseos. The doubt expressed by
Cotta is solved according to some by assuming that the ox was only one of
dough.

165. 5. Quamvis licet. Other examples of this easily-explained
usage may be found in Kiihner's Tusc. IV, 24, 53 note.

165. 9. ut Diogenes dicebat. A reference to the saying cited above

c. 34, 83.

165. 12. Diagoras. See note on Ι, 23, 63. The same story is toldgg
of Diogenes the Cynic instead of Diagoras, Diog. L. VI, 59.

165. 13. atque ei quidam amicus. The omission of the verbum
dicendi is not so violent as to prove the passage necessarily corrupt. Cf.
F. A. Wolf Verm. Sehr„ pp. 159, 160. Tac. Hist. IV, 75: ad ea Cerialis
Civili et Classico nihil. The verb sor nescio quid is also wanting above c. 5.

165. 14. ex tot tabulis pictis, i.e. of votive tablets. Schol. Cruq. ad
Horat. Sat. ΙΙ, 1, 32: Voliva tabula est, quae ex voto posita est in templo
aut aliquo loco publico, in qua descripta Ιι, e. depicta est sbrtumz alicuius.
Ita solent naufragi suum nazqfragy'um in tabella depictum . . . in templis
alicui deo consecratum suspendere. The Samothracian deities especially
were invoked by mariners.

165. 17. inquit3 with reference to Π, 66, 167; said not especially of 9ο
Balbus, but of any opponent whatever 3 inquit is often so used.
