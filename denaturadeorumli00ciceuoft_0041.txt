SUMMARY. 29

believe in any gods, but only made a pretence of doing so, in
order to avoid unpopularity (120-124).

This is the summary of the first book3 a few observations on the
Academic’s criticisrn of the theology of Epicurus have been already
made in the notes; but it may not be amiss to weigh it a little more
carefully. Any person possessing a moderate acquaintance with the
history of ancient philosophy and the contests of the various schools
knows that the fighting was not always done with fair weaponS, but
that misrepresentation and unjust deductions from the adversaries'
propositions were not uncommon. There is no want of this in
Cotta's discourse. We must recognize the reproach as well founded
that the Epicurean theology undermined and destroyed all religion j
worthy of the name ; and when Epicurus notwithstanding this talked
of pious reverence for the gods because of their essential excellence.
we may at least doubt whether he was really in earnest. So far as
we can see from the remains of his writings or those of his followers,
⁷ the idea of εὐσέβεια was limited simply to a belief in the immor-
tality and perfect happiness of the gods, and the rejection of all
such conceptions as were inconsistent with it3 and these included
not only the mythological fables and many perverted and contra-
dictory notions of the common crowd. but the teachings of other
philosophers as well, who ascribed to the gods the government of
the world and a care for earthly and human affairs: for Epicurus
thought that this would give the gods an occupatiori so troublesome,
burdensome and vexatious, that such a thing as happiness would be
for them impossible. If the Epicureans did not entirely withdraw
from the traclitional rites of religion, they did so chiefly in order to
give no offence, which might perhaps have brought thern into dan-
ger (Plutarch, Non posse snczv. ‘vivi etc.‚ c. 21) ς they did not disdain
even to hold the priestly offices (Lucian, conviv. s. Lapith.‚ c. 9) 3
and it is quite credible, as Cicero assures us (c. 30, 85), that many
of them, however free-thinking they may have been in theory, were
yet in practice exceedingly superstitious. Similar contradictions be-
tween theory and practice have always been common in this matter.¹

 

1 In regard to Epicurus personally we may confidently assume that in spite
of all breaking away sromreligion in his philosophical speculations he still had
a leaning to it at beart, for there are many signs of it in his letters and in
