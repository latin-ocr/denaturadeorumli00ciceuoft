SUMMARv. 75

which are to be regarded as purely voluntary, depending on a sys-
tematic choice, and hence as a proof of their divinity (43, 44). -
Thus far we have been concerned with the proof os the existence
of the gods3 next follows the second part, or the question as to
their nature. This has already been partially answered in the first
part3 for having proved the existence of an animating and conserv-
ing principle of fire in the universe, and having attributed to it
consciousness and reason and also divinity‚ we have substantially
shown that the deity is such an all-pervading‚ animating, conserv-
ing, reasoning principle of fire3 furthermore that the universe, as
being filled and animated by this principle, is itself to be called
God.¹ In beginning, therefore, with the proposition that the uni-
verse is God, and in putting it upon the ground that according to
universal natural consciousness the deity must be a living being,
and the most perfect one, and that nothing answers to this idea
better than the universe itself, Balbus only repeats what he had
already said under the previous head. He adds to this a hit at the
Epicureans who ridiculed this spherical deity (for the Stoics as
well as the majority of people believed in the spherica] form of the
world, while the Epicureans doubted it) (46-48)3 hence the rea-
sons sor this shape of the universe and of the heavenly bodies as
well are derived from the movements of the heavens and the stars
(49-53) ς and the argument for the divinity of the heavenly bodies,
drawn from the regularity of their movements‚ is incidentally re-
peated (54—56). Balbus now makes use of these propositions to
establish the Stoic definition of nature given by Zeno, that it is a
sort of heat possessing creative energy and working in an intelli-
gent and methodical manner; or in other words the animating and
thinking principle of heat before referred to. This nature, so far as
it is operative in the universe, may be called the soul of the universe

ἁπάσης οὐσίας ἰδίως ποιόν, ὃς δὴ ἁφθαρτός ἐστι καὶ dyeia-mos, δημιουρ) ὸς ὧν
τῆς διακοσμήσεως κατὰ χρόνων ποιὰς περιόδους ἀναλίσκων εἰς ἑαυτὸν τὴν ᾶπα-
σαυ οὐσίαν καὶ πάλιν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ γεννῶν ς (it is therefore the primaeval creative
being, which makes all other beings to proceed from its own fullness and again
receives thern back into itself). Καὶ αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν διακόσμησιν τῶι· ἀστέρων
