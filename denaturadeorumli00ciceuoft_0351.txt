have alque or et eiusmodi, so that eiusmodi would stand for the subject,
which is quite contrary to usage.

155. 2. Nam mentem. We must supply some phrase like: idemque 261
de reliquis dicendum est, to which nam relates, inas-much as it clearly does
not introduce the reason of the proposition immediately preceding. It is
here rather a particle of transition ; and the usage is in such cases to be
explained by supplying an intermediate clause in conformity with the con·
text. So above e. 6, 15 ; sor further details see Hand Turseli. ΙΙΙ, 147.

155. 4. in nobiSmet insunt ipsis. Cf. the explanation in ΙΙ, 23, 61
and the note. In regard to honos, salus and victoria- the Stoic might
have offered an ausu-er, and for Fortuna he would perhaps have said that
what appeared to men as inconstantia and temeritas was not really such,
but only an ὰιθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ drinio( αἰτία, according to Plut. De Plac.
Phil. 1, 29 and Stobaeus Ecl. Ι, p. 218.

155. 15· fuisse sapientes videantur. Cf. I, 15, 41. ω

155. 16. quod miserandum sit, laboratiszlaborenz, qui mise-
randus sit, suscipitis.

155. 20. Quid Veiovi facies? Festus answers this, p. 379: lf'e syl-
labam rei parvae praeponebant, unde Veiovenz parvum [twem. Of the
correctness of the answer we will say nothing ; but we see from Ovid Fast.
ΙΙΙ, 445 that by Veiovis many people understood a small, youthful Jupiter.
—The etymology of Volcanus is found in Isidorus, p. 1026, 32 Goth:
dictus Volcanus quasi volans candor, vel quasi volicanus, quod per aerem
volet, which is at the least no worse than the most of those given by Bal-
bus ΙΙ, 25-27, or than a recent one, which derives the name from the
Greek, Ὁλκαῖος z “ dragging the foot‚'' because os his lameness. Com-
parative philology refers the name to a Sanscrit root ulka, valka, which
means “ burning.’‘

155. 23. natare visus es :fluctuare‚ move hither and thither with·
out sure footing, titubare, “to be all adrift.'⁷ Cf. Horat. Sat. ΙΙ, 7, 6:
Pars multa natal, modo recta capessens, interdum pravis obnoxia.

155. 29. figuras deorum: divine forms, in which the gods are em· 63
bodied and live.

155. 30. Qui tantus error fuit. “The error of deifying natural ob· 25
jects went so far.''——- The deification of Febris Cicero mentions and dis-
approves in De Leg. Ι, 11, 28, but speaks only os an altar ; so in regard to
Mala Fortuna. Orbona is mentioned by Tertullian Ad. Nat. ΙΙ, 15 as
a goddess, quae in orbitatem semina extinguat. But in that passage the
Mss. have Orbana.
