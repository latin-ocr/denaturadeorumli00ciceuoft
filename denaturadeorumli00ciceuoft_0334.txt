295 NOTES.

141. 35. illa etiam differemus. The plural is used because the
pronoun refers not only to quod Chrysippum dicere aiebas, but to the more
remote quae . . . comparabas, et cum . . . adserebas. Comp. 11, 50, 126 ;
59, 147. The words quae in domo pulchra cum pulchritudine mundi com-
parabas are to be taken as a shorter expression sor quae in domo pulchra
cum pulchritudine mundi comparandti dice-bas: t'or taken literally they
would not agree with what Balbus had said 11, 6, 17, and with what Cotta
would be likely to sayl— Before the following cum . . . adferebas one
must supply of course quae dicebas.

142. 7. physice. Comp. Ι, 27, 77 and 11, 18, 48. Here too there is a
little irony, t'or the physics os the Stoics amounted to very little sor an
Academic.

142. ιο. cum docere velles deos esse, i.e. in that part of your dis-
course where you attempted to prove the existence Of the gods. The sol-
lowing words, quare el mundus &c., are to be taken with quac a te nudius
tertius dicta sunt, “the reasons which you adduced to show that the uni·
verse &c. was endowed with feeling and mindst - For numus tertIus see

Introd., p. 20.

14²· 19. sed ab hae ea quaestione . . . sepau-autum i.e. the com-
plete proos os the reality os divination falls under another head; in the
investigation of the existence and nature of the gods it is taken sor
granted.

142. 29. Modo possemus eum animantem cogitare. This is not to
be construed with the preceding dicebas and non dubitabas, as is Cotta
meant to represent it as having been said by Balbus; sor Balbus did not
make this a condition; he merely deduced the animation os the world
as a necessary consequence from the proposition that it was the best and
most perfect of everything. Cotta now objects to this deductiori, that it
involves something inconceivable. Before Modo possemus we must supply
something like recte, or non intercederem or the like. For modo see Hand
Tursell. 111, p. 638.

142. 30. cogitare vel potius . . . eernere. One can think, cog-itare
in the wider sense of the word, of all soris of things, even of phantoms; but
we can really pereeive, cernere, only what is true and actually existing.

142. 34. nullo modo prorsus sor prorsus nullo modo. The adverb
strengthens the negation, the negation does not negative the adverb. So
prorsus strengthening the negation is placed aster non in De Fin. Π, 5, 17:
Λόιι prorsus. inquil: “not at all,‘' not. “not quite.’‘ Comp. Madvig's
note. So with the ordinary non omnino, whereas omnino non is more
rare. So in Greek osten, οὶ· πάνυ, οὑκ thav,
