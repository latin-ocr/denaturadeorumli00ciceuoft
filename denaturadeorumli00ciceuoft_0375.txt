I, 37, 103. The reading of the Mss„ superior aetheri, ignibus altissima
ora reddatur, retained by Baiter, seems to me plainly erroneouS‚ and seems
to have arisen from some one's explaining tgrnibus, which here as in c. 15,
39 (see note) means the aether, by aetheri, and by this note creeping into
the text and taking the place of the proper reading aeri. If aether is
sometimes used for αὲν (see Munro on Lucretius 11, 1115), such a use
would be incredible here, where the clement opposed to the ignibus and

situated below them is in question.

1, 37, 105. It seems proper here to discuss the passage of Diog. L. X,
139 which, as it is preserved in the Mss„ partly coincides with what Cotta
here and Velleius in c. 19, 49 give as the doctrine of Epicurus, but partly
differs so much, that some have felt obliged to infer that Epicurus held a
doctrine about the gods which is mentioned neither by Cicero nor by any·
one else, while others hold the passage as corrupt and any restoration dif-
‘ficult or impossible. The passage runs thus in the Mss.: ἑυ ἀλλοις ὁὲ φησιν
(i.e. Ἐπίκουρος) τοὺς θεοὺς λόγῳ θεωρητοὶ-ς, οὓς μὲν κατ’ ἀριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας,
οὓς δὲ κατὰ ὀμοειδίαν ὲκ τῆς συνεχοῦς ἑπιρῥίπεως τῶν ὁμοίων εὶὸὠὶων ἐπὶ τὸ
αὐτὸ ἁποτετεῗεσμὲνων ὰνθρωποειὸῶς. If the reading be correct, it is clear
that two classes of gods are here distinguished ; and hence several writers,
Tennemann (Gesch. d. Phil. ΙΙΙ, p. 416 f.)‚ Heindorf (on Cic. D. N. Ι, 19,
5ο), Steinliart (article on Epicurus in the Allgem. Encyklop. d. XVissensch.
u. Kiinste‚ Ι, 35, p. 477, note 64), Hegel (Vorles. ii. d. Gesch. d. Philos.
published by Michelet‚ XVerke Th. XIV, p. 507), have accepted such a dis-
tinction and attempted to explain it in their own way. In my essay De
Epicuri Theologia‚ p. 352 ff. 1 have set forth the arguments against this in
detail. Ι think Ι have shown that the distinction is quite inadmissible, and
that in the passage of Diogenes the οὓς μὲν . . . οὓς δέ must be necessarily
regarded as corrupt. Cassendi and Meiners have already expressed the
same opinion. The former proposed οὐ μέν, ὠς δέ, the latter (Verm. Phi-
los. Schr. 11, p. 121) οὑ μέν . . , ἀλλά. My own is perhaps a more proba-
ble emendation: οὐ μὲν κατ’ ἀριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας [flocti-pit δὲ κατὰ ὁμοει-
ὁίαν διε. After >vom-rob( was mutilated as Ι have indicated, and the remain-
ing οὺς taken for οὓς, nothing was easier than to change the preceding οὐ
μέν into οὓς μὲν, so that οὓς δὲ could be referred to it. The passage thus
corrected agrees perfectly with what we know from other sources. The
κατ’ ἀριθμόν corresponds to ad numerum: the gods cannot be counted, not
individually distinguished by us; but they are still perceivable in conse-
quence of the similar nature of the impressions continually coming to us
from them. It is clear that ἑπιρῥίπεως and transitione mean the same
thing ; but it will hardly occur to any one to take them as meaning only
