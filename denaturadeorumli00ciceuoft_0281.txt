extremum the whole sursace or the whole circumference3 but imagined
two diametrieally opposed points, one above the centre called summum,
the other below, which would have been inore correctly called imum, not
exlremum. In this case the error would only be that an expression which
might be applied to other bodies or ligures is here applied to the sphere or
circle alone.

93. 10. eruditum illum pulverem, i.e. mathematieal studies; be· 48
cause the old mathematicians made use of a table covered with fine sand
and a small stick called radius to draw geometrical figures. [Tusc. V, 23,
64: ex eadem urbe humilem homunculum a pulvere et radio excitabo, qui
mullis annis post ficit, Archimedem] —physici, with irony. Comp. I,
27, 77·

93. 18. caeli palatum. Probably palatum was originally “what 49
covers like an arch,'’ and hence could be used os the heavens that overarch
the earth, as well as of the palate that overarches the mouth. The Greek
οὐρανός also means both palate and heaven3 and the same homonymy
is found in other languages, as J. Grimm remarks in Haupt's Zeitschr. fiir
Deutsches Alterthurn VI, p. 541.

93. 19. quorum alterum, i.e. the fixed stars.—alterum autem, the 19
planets.——-conversiones duas; two sorts of revolutions‚ a daily one
around the earth from East to XVest‚ and another around the sun from
VVest to East ; in c. 20 he speaks of the different periods required for this
last in the case os different bodies. —isdem spatiis, sc. ult-amque: each
of these two revolutions always takes place in the same path: for this is
the proper meaning os spatium. Comp. c. 40, 103.

93. 26. easdem . . . opacet. It is incorrect to say that the sun
darkens any part of the earth. It leaves it in shade while it is shining on
the opposite side. So Horace improperly says in the Carm. Sacc. 9: alme
sol, curru nitido diem qui promis et celas ,· and when Pliny H. N. ΙΙ, 5, 4
says lcic (sol) reliqua sidera occultat, illustrat, the illustrare can only
happen when the sun sets and so allows the stars to become visible. So
Livy XXXHI, 7, 9 says: iuga manlium detexerat nebula, the mist, i.e. by
passing away. Comp. below c. 40, 102. Similar examples in Reisig
Vorles„ p. 306 with Haase’s note ; and Lobeck Paralip., p, 5 59; Kiihner
Ausf. Gram. ξ 597 r., p. 1074.

93. 27. umbra terrae soli officiens, the shadow of the earth which
shuts out the sun, i.e. the light of the sun. The conical shadow of the
earth, falling in any part of the heavens, banishes in a certain sense the

light of the sun, and makes night; hence umbra terrae mela noctis, De Div.
11, 6, 17.
