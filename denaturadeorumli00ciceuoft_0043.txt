SUMMARY. 3 1

it was quite consistent to assign thern a separate abode in the inter-
mundia (see note on c. 8. 18). Epicurus probably did not express
himself further on their manner os life in the intermundia. but sim-
ply ascribed to them the undisturbed enjoyment of the highest hap-
pineSS‚ without entering into details; sor he was shrewd enough to
see that it was impossible to know anything about it, and that
everybody must be allowed to fancy it as it seemed to him most
probable. with the limitation of course that the conception did not
conflict with their happiness and immortality.

His opponents especially ridiculed his theory of the qnasicorpo-
realily of the gods. which was really undeserving of it (see note on
c. 18. 49). The bodily likeness os the gods to men, which Epicurus
assumed for the reasons indicated by Velleius, was considered by
them as ridiculous on the ground that the gods. in the utter quiet
and inactivity of their lives. would have no use sor the organs and
members of the human body3 as if Epicurus had really meant by
quiet and inactivity an absolutely immovable torpidity (67-102)‚ and
not rather a simple freedom from everything like labor and trouble,
which was quite compatible with a life spent in pleasures and enjoy-
ments‚ only of other and more refined sorts than the earthly and
human pleasures: compatible too with virtues, though of course not
quite the same as those springing from earthly and human relations,
but rather those corresponding to the conditions of the divine ex-
istence. Again when his opponents ridiculed Epicurus on the one
hand for setting up male and female deities, including naturally
the sexual relations between them¹3 and on the other for making
them all alike‚ and hence unable to distinguish one another
(80-84), it is evident that one objection contradicts the other, and
one of the two must be false. The truth probably is this: Epicurus
taught that by means of the impressions or pictures which come
from the gods to the soul of man we acquire only a general concep-
tion of gods similar to men, not one of individua] distinguishable
divine personalities3 this does not however exclude the possibility
of their actual existence3 and when he spoke of sexual and other

1 Objections similar to those brought by Cotta against the bodily nature of
the gods os Epicurus have long ago suggested themselves to Christian theolo-
gians against the bodily nature of men after the resurrection frorn the dead.
