BOOK 11.—-Cnm›. XIII-XV, ξς 35-40. 245

89. 32. Scite enim Chrysippus. The sense os the argument which 14
Cicero does not bring out very clearly is doubtless this: All which simply
serves something else as a means to an end is not absolutely, but only rela-
tively perfect. The universe alone, since it coniprehends everything within
itself and so serves nothing else as a means, is its own end and absolutely
perfect. Hence that cannot be wanting to it without which it would not
be absolutely perfect, namely, reason. —- On enim see note c. 16 init.

90. 3. ad mundum . . . Imitandum. This does not refer io an arti-
ficial or an artistic imitation of nature, but to a conformity in will and deed
with the supreme law of reason and right ; the ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φί-σει ζῆν.
Comp. De Senect. c. 21, 77: Sed credo deos immortales sparsisse animos
in corpora humana, ut essen! qui terras tuerentur, quique caelestium ordi-
nem contemplantes imitarentur eum vitae modo alque constantia: Senee.
De Vita Beata c. 3: a nalurtz non deerrare el (ια’ illius legem exemplumque
formari, sapientia est. Other examples in Beier on Cic. De Osfic. Ι,
p. 325.

90. 4. [Sed mundus . . . complexus est. We should expect the 38
present here; comp. De Fin. ΙΙ, 34, 112: non . . . maria pedibus pera-
grantem, scd omne coelum . . . complexum ,· and ibid. ΙΙΙ, 5, 17: quiddam

. . complexum el continens veritatem]

90. 9. similitudines adiungens. Chrysippus osten used them; see
above c. 8, 22.

90. 15. efficitur tamen in homine virtus. The general idea of 39
virtus according to De Leg. 1, 8, 22 is nillil aliud quam in se perfecta
et ad summum perducta natura, the complete development of all the
faculties and eapacities of any being: τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι of Aristotle. Such
virtus is realized (efficitur-s ad cffectzmz perducitur) iu man, i.e. in the
wise man (ξ 36), although rarely and with difficulty because of the hin-
drances which oppose him. It is however always realized in the divine
universe which nothing hinders (ξ 35).

90. 19. quae . . . gignuntur. Comp. c. 36, 92.—We have already 15
seen Ι, 10, 253 11, 275 12, 30 that other philosophers before the Stoics
considered the heavenly bodies to be gods.

90. 22. animantia. Comp. Somn. Scip. c. 3: ex illis sempiternis
genibus, quae sidera el slellas vocatis, quae . . . divinis animatae menti-
bus ἃς.

90. 25. inmenso mundo. Cleomed. ΙΙ, 84: πάντα τὸν κόσμον φωτίζει 4ο
σχεδὸν ὰπειρομεγέθη ὄντα. Inmenso mundo is a dativus commodi. [Schoe-
mann does not supply the in.]

90. 26. is elus tactus est, “its effect, its influence upon us is such '';
