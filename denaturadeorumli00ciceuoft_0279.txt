BOOK IL—CHAP. XVI, XVII, ξς 41-45. 247

91. 26. neque naturam significat, “points neither to a mere force
of nature‚'' i.e. a blind and uneonseious soree. For this signification os the
word, which the connection absolutely requires, comp. c. 32, 813 1, 13, 35;
and ΙΙΙ, 11, 27. Significare is used in the same way e. 22, 54: significant
eandem mentem alque prudentiam ,· and c. 33, 85: tantam naturae sol-
lertiam szg‘nifical,· declarare in the same sense is found in c. 32, 81.

91. 30. aut natura aut vi aut voluntate. It is plain that natura 44
here denotes the force of nature that works unconsciously in everything,
vis a soree that operates from without ; to both these is opposed the motion
resulting from free will and inherent power. This view os Aristotle, as well
as that cited above ξ 42, occurred doubtless in the dialogue περὶ φὺιισοφίας.
No passage that exactly corresponds is found in Lis extant writings‚ but in
De Caelo 111, 2 he says: ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἡ βίαιον εἶναι τὴν κίνησιν ὴ κατὰ ‹pi-mv.
In the same work 1, 2 however he distinguishes a motion of three kinds,
ἐπὶ τὸ μέσον, ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσου, περὶ τὸ μέσον. The last, the circular motion, is
by nature peculiar to what he calls the πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, and what others
call aether ,· the heavens and the heavenly bodies are composed of this
πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, their rnotion being so far a natural one, and yet withal
a voluntary one ; this is to be understood of the planets.

91. 33. [in] sublime. The preposition probably was added by copy-
ists, who were unacquainted with the adverbial use of sublime. Comp.
Priscian XVII, 1, 11 and the citations of Kiihner, Tuse. Ι, 17, 40.

92. 15. certa notione animi praesentiamus. This expression, like ξε.)
the following praesensionem notionemque nostram, refers to the πρόληψις,
which the Stoics believed in, like the Epicureans. See note Ι, 17, 44 and
14, 37. It is a φυσικὴ {arvom (Diog. L. VII, 54), which arises in the mind
without particular teaching or reflexion, ἀνευ διδασκαλίας καὶ ἐπιμελείας, in
a natural and simple manner, ἀνεπιτεχνήτως. Plut. Plac. Phil. IV, 11. In
another passage, De Stoic. Rep. c. 17, these προλήψεις are also calss xl ἐμφυ-
τυι ἰῃ the same sense as Cicero calls thern innatas c. 4, 12.—- Man has
then a natural preeonceived notion of the divine nature, and is convinced
of the substantial truth of this notion immediately, intujtively‚ and without
proof ; and he admits the truth of any further scientific idea of the divine
nature only in so far as he finds it to correspond to this preeonceived
noti0n‚ so far as he can bring it into harmony with that; this Cicero ex-
presses below by accommodare ,· comp. Orat. c. 7, 23: unum (Demosthe-
nem) accommodare adeam, quam sentiam, eloquentiam.

92. 18. primum hunc ipsum mundum. The eorresponding deinde
is wanting. The heavenly bodies evidently would come next; but in the
tii-ade against Epicurus Cicero forgets so entirely the form of the sentence,
