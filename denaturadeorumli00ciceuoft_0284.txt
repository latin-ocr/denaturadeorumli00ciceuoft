with which it revolved. The clearest exposition of the matter is given by
Schwegler on Aristot. Metaph. XII, 8, 12, p. 274 ff. Comp. also Ideler on
Arist. Meteor. Ι, p. 418.

56 95. 27. nec vanitas, “ no unreliableness, falsity.” They never falsify
the reckoning; as above c. 5, 15 it is said: in quihus nihil umquam in-
mensa ct infinita vetustas mentita sit.

95. 27. omnis ordo, “ complete order ‘⁷ ; so c. 22 sm. omnis ornatus.

57 95. 33. Haud ergo ἃς. I fancy I shall make no mistake if, after what
1 have already said, Ι commence my discussion about the godhead, or na-
ture (which according to the Stoics are the same), with a quotation from
Zeno.

22 96. 1. ignem esse artificiosum Sec. Diog. L. V11, 156: δοκεῖ δὲ
αὐτοῖς (τοῖς Στωϊκοῖς) τὴν φῦσιν εἶναι πῦρ τεχνικὸν ὁδῷ βαδίζον εἰς γένεσιν,
ὀὸᾡ βαδίζον denotes a mode of operation constant, definite and designed,
as also below c. 32, 81. In distinction from this πῐψ τεχνικόν Zeno called .
the earthly tire πῦρ ἄτεχνον, as Balbus above c. 15, 41 called it confictor et
consumptor omnium. Stobae. Ecl. 1, p. 358. From another point of view
AEschylus (Prom. v. 7) calls it from-fxvov because of its usefulness for
various arts.

96. 5. magistrum artium reliquarum. Apuleius (De Mundo,
Tom 11, p. 134 Altenb.) expresses the idea involved in this as follows:
Αἰιηι ([ιιίιί, oro te, ornatum alque ordinatum videri potest, quod non ab
ipsius (mundi) exemplo immatura sit ratio ,Ρ All artistic effort is a cre-
ation with intelligence and design after the example of nature, which
creates with intelligence and design. Omnis ars est imitatio naturae,
Senec. Ep. 65.

96. 6. omnis natura3 every force of nature, acting in any portion of
the universe or in any single being, in contrast to the natura ipsius mundi,
the universal nature working throughout the universe. Comp. c. 10, 28.

58 96. 9. non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex. The former is
less than the latter ; artificiosus may he said of one who lm a high degree
of skill without being a thorough artist, an artist by profession ; the latter
is the arlifi'x, the artist in all that he undertakes.

96. 11. ut ceterae naturae . . . sic natura mundi. Ut . . . sic
introduce not only parallel but contrasted expressions. (See Goerenz on
De Fin. 1, ι, 3.) As on the one hand the nature of individual beings is
bound up in and conditioned by their semina, their germs in which the
law of their development is contained (in seminibus vis inest earum
rerum, quae ex iis progfignuntur, De Div. 1, 56, 128), so on the other
hand universal nature follows her own free and rational determination.
