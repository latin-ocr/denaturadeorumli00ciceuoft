332 DE NATURA DEORUM.

μακάριον ἐννοήσας τὸν θεὸν εἶναι τοῦτο νόμιζε; imagine to thyself an immor-
tal and happy being, and think that God is such a one. The ideas of im-
mortality and happiness might or must have arisen in the mind as the
natural opposites of mis-cry and mortality‚ whether impressions came to it
from the gods or not; but there is none among all the objects, from which
impressions come, to which these ideas correspond, all of these are proved
to be mortal and not happy with the single exception of the gods, per·
ceived by means of their impressions always uniformly appearing. If then
there are any immortal and happy beings, and there is no sufficient ground
to deny it, the gods must be such. De hoc argumentandi genere utcumque
iudicabitur, hoc tamen fatendum erit, non infirmius esse, quam quo alios

quoque theologos philosophantes in divinarum rerum quaestionibus usos
esse hodieque uti videmus.

1, 24, 66. Democritus derived the origin and further development of
all things by necessity from the motion, the whirl (δίνη) of atoms, as Cicero
himself sayS, De Fato, c. 10, 23: Democritus, auctor atomorum, accipere
maluit necessitate onmia fieri, quam a corporibus individuis naturales
motus avellere ,· and Diog. L. IX, 45: πάντα κατ’ ἁνάὶκην γίνεσθαι, τῆς
δίνης αἰτίας οἶπης τῆς >erimine πάντων, ἢν ἀνά) mlv HVJ. But since this
necessity existed nowhere else than in the atoms themselves, and the δίνη
was not caused by anything external to them, Cicero was right in saying

nulla cogente natura and calling the concourse of the atoms fortuitous,just ,

as Aristotle referring to the doctrine of Democritus and Leucippus says,
Physic. ΙΙ, 4: ἀπὸ ταύτομάτου γίγνεσθαι τὴν δίνην καὶ τὴν κίνησιν τὴν δια-
κρὶνασαν καὶ καταστῆσασαν εὶς rain-7711 τὴν τάξιν τὸ πᾶν, For Democritus did
not accept any sort of nature external to and working upon the atoms, or
any regulation os their motions toward a given end. Cotnp. Bonitz on
Aristot. Metaph„ p. 76. There was no reason therefore to accuse Cicero
of an error in the matter, as the most recent translator has done.

1, 2 5, 71. The proper sense of the phrase concretio individuorum corpo-
rum is given in the note. The misunderstanding of this has misled not only
Lactantius, De Ira Dei, c. 10, 27, but some earlier writers on the history of
philosophy, to the opinion that Epicurus either held the gods to be entirely
incorporeaL or at least attributed to them bodies consisting not of atoms
but of some indeterminable substance. More upon this subject may be

found in Sehoemann's Schediasma De Epicuri Theologia, Opusc. Ac.
IV, 342.

1, 28, 79. The naevus in articulo pueri might seem too small a mat-
ter to be at all regarded by the lover. It has therefore been proposed to
read naevus in Lyco puero ,· one Ms. has in Pericle puero.
