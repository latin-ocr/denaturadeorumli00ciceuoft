cessor of the Academic scepticism and the opposition to the dogmatism
of the other schools because of his assertion: That he knew only one
thing, namely, that he knew nothing; and because of the reasoning he
used to convict of ignoranee those who boasted of knowing something.

sor as Cicero says, Acad. Ι, 12, 45, negabat esse quidquam quod sciri posset,
ne illud quidem ipsum, quod Socrates sibi reliquisset ,· sic omnia latere in

tainly one of trulla, although in the end they only arrived at the result
that in the absence of a sure criterion a certain aud definite knowledge of
the truth was unattainable and that one rnust rest satisfied with probability.
De Fin. II, 14, 43: Quasi desperata cognitione certa id sequi volunt, quod
veri simile videtur. Acad. ΙΙ, 3, 7: nilzil aliud agunt, nisi ut in utram-

not certain, which still may furnish to a reasonable man sufficient guides
sor his practical actions.——Visum, accus. from the verbal subst. visus,
synonymous with visio, properly signifies the mental act of the person
beholding; it may however be applied to the object which gives rise to
the perception; as here visum insignem et illustrem habere, “to cause a
definite and clear perception '’ (eine bestimmte und blare Ansclmuung
bewirken). [Professor Schoemann here seems to take visum as the act
of perception, and habere in the sense of “to cause.’' But it would seem
better to take visum z speciem, the sense of the passage being that some
things have an appearance sufficiently clear for practical purposes, though
they may have no perfectly sure criterion. Cornp. Acad. II, 31, 101:
