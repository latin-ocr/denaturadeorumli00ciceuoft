INTRODUCTION.

-ψ-

ICERO'S essay on the nature of the gods is at once our most
accessible and most complete original authority on the theology
of the ancients; it gives us a brief outline of the views of the older
thinkers and a complete exposition of the doctrines of those schools
of philosophy which in later times included the greater number of
educated people. The reader will perhaps be better able to under-
stand the book after a few introductory remarks on the ancient the-
ology and its various schools.

The philosophy of religion has to deal with the most important
questions which can occupy the human mind. These regard the
existence and nature of those unseen powers which are felt by man
to control both his own inner and outer life, and the visible world
about him. There is one answer ever ready for these questionsz'
religion, older than any philosophy, offers a body of more or less
definite conceptions which constitute the popular faith3 and this
saith is realized in the public worship and in the whole religious tone
of the people. But in this as in all other matters there comes a
time in the intellectual development of all nations when the more
advanced minds feel a need, which is the beginning and end of all
philosophy, the need of positive knowledge. People are no longer
able to accept the traditions of religion upon mere faith3 they ask
for the reason of saith, for the ground of the prevailing ideas3 and
if religion cannot make good its claims by appeal to a higher
authority, to a divine revelation, and thus raise its domain above
all doubt or cavil (a thing which the religions of antiquity neither
were able nor pretended to do), the necessary consequence is that
reason makes an attempt to find an answer to these questions in
her own way3 and she then concedes the truth of the traditional
saith only in so far as it coincides with or at least does not contra-

dict her own conclusions.
