to figures of wax or clay.'’

‘12 53. ιο. dictata, passages, chiefly from poets, which were dictated to
scholars to be learned by heart. Comp. Hor. Ep. 1, 18, 13 ε puerum saevo
credas dictata magistro reddere.

53. 12. in scriptis. Diog. L. X, 13 mentions a saying of Epicurus of
this sort in a letter. He also cites from another letter (ξ 6) the words:
παιδείαν δὲ πᾶσαν, μακάριε, φεῦγε.

5 3. 14. nihil enirn olet :— nullum odorem olet ,· i.e. he shows no famili·
arity with the schools os Plato or Aristotle, the former of whom taught in
the Academy, the latter in the Lyceum, both names of gymnasia at Athens.
Ad Attic. 11, 1, 1 ε ideo bene olere, quia nihil olebant, videbantur.

53. 15. e puerilibus disciplinis. He means the so-ealled ὲγκὺκλιος
παιδεία, that is, the usual course of instruction, consisting chiefly of gram-
mar and rhetoric.

53. 16. Xenocraten. See note to 13, 34.

53. 18. Pamphilum. He is also mentioned in Diog. L. X, 14, but is
otherwise unknown. XVhether he is the same with the author os a τέχνη
ῥητωρ. mentioned by Arist. Rhet. 11, 23, we cannot tell. Comp. Spalding's
note to Quintil. 111, 6, 34.

53. 20. agripeta, i.e. as colonist, Gr. κληροῖνχος, because in the year
nc. 35¹ the Athenians gave to the poorer citizens the confiscated land in
Samos, dividcd into 2000 sections (κλῆροι).

73 53. 23. ln Nausiphane . . . tenetur. The sense is: In regard to
Nausiphanes he cannot avoid it ; he is proved to have learned something
from him, which he would not allow in regard to Pamphilus, though he
consessed to having hem-<1 him. Comp. Orat. pro Caec. c. 2 2 facile hones-
tissimis testibus in re perspicua teneretur, i.e. convinceretur ,· and further
Ernesti Clav. Cic. sub tit. —Nausiphanes of Teos according to Sext. Emp.
Math. Ι, 2, p. 599, Bekk. and Diog. L. IX, 69 was a disciple of the sceptic
Pynhon, but is spoken os by Diog. Praef. 15 as a follower of Democritus.
Cotta also says below c. 33, 93 that Epicurus learned something from him.
It was maintained that he was indebted to him sor his logie (see note to e.
16, 43). For remarks of Epicurus about him see Diog. L. Χ, 14, and 7, 8.

53. 26. quid audierat? The sense is: Epicurus spoke insultingly ¹
of Nausiphanes as if he owed nothing to him. And ¹vet if he had not
learned something from him what could he have learned at all? He
would have been utterly ignorant, and would not have known even these
doctrines of Democritus, on which his whole system of physics rests.

5 3. 30. naturae ratio. Comp. c. 8, 20 : physiologiam, id est naturae
rationem, and note.
