3 12 NOTES.

154. 7. Νόμιον. Apollo shares this surname with Hermes. Arist.
Thesm. V. 977. It really means however not the lawgiver, as Cicero and
others explain it, but the god os the pastures and flocks; and Ἀπόλλων
νόμως is properly, so far as the idea is concerned, the same with Aristaeus,
mentioned in e. 18, 45 as the son os Apollo. (js. l‘ind. Pyth. lx, 65 (115).
The sorni Abmionem of the Mss. is only an error os the copyists.

154. 10. Upis as the name of a male deity only occurs here. It is
often found as a surname of Diana, where it is regarded as a collateral
sorm of ὁπις, ὠπις, and explained as referring to the oversight of the actions
of men and to the punishment of their transgressions.

154. 12. Dionysos multos. It is extraordinary that just here the
Dionysus of the common mythology, son of Zeus and Semele, is passed
over. Those that are mentioned all belong either to the Orphic or other
rables unknown to us. —On the Trieterides see Schoem. Griech. Alterth.
11³, p. 502.

154. 17. [Elide. Eli Mss. and Baiter ΙΙ.]

154. 23. orta Nilo. The Aegyptian Neith is meant, commonly iden·
titied with Minerva; although others call her not the daughter of Nilus,
but of Zeus (Diod. Ι, 13), oros Hermes (Plut. De Is. et Osis, c. 7). Ac-
cording however to Jablonski, l'anth. A. 1, p. 168, Nilus is just the same
as Zeus.

154. 24. [a Iove. Schoemann omits the preposition.]

154. 25. Coryphe probably owes her origin to later mythologists, who ’
explained the story of the birth of Minerva from the head (ἐκ κορυφῆς) of
Zeus by substituting a nymph, Cotyplze, sor the head. Cf. Schoem. Opusc.
Ac. ΙΙ, p. 163.—For the following, ‹liughter of Pallas, see Tzetz. on
Lycophr. v. 355, and Miiller Kl. Sehr. 11, p. 135.

154- 32. quibus intellegis resistendum osso. When Cotta in this
passage, as also in c. 21, 53 speaks against Euhemerism, he does so solely
in the interest of religion, of which in several passages Ι, 22, 61 and 623
111, 2, 5. 6 he has avowed himself a devoted adherent. lle wishes there-
fore that the popular (leities should be considered not only as rnen who
have been wrongly deilied, but as really gods. As an Academic he could
attach no importance to this ς he must on the contrary have considered the
rables about the gods as reprehensible in so sar as they were believed to
be real histories of the gods ; and Euhemerism, which took ground against
this belief and considered them merely as accounts of the actions of men,
must have rather seemed to him commendable. -Cotta might however
blame the Stoics from both points of view, because instead of setting them
aside they appeared by explaining them allegorically to bring them to a
certain extent into credit again. -— Instead of aliaque eiusmodi the Mss.
