BOOK 1.—cm. xxvn, §5 72-77· 21 1

53. 3¹· istud quasi eorpus . . . quid intellegis? The argument
is here resumed aster the digression, “ now what do you understand by this
quasi corpus?'’ Comp. De F in. 11, 15, 50: Quid ergo lzoc loco intellegit
honestum ? Paradox VI, 1 : quem enim intellegimus divitem, aut hoc ver-
bum in quo homine ponimus ?

53. 32. [Ego enim te sclre ἃς. The sense is : Ι am quite willing to 74
acknowledge that you know more about these things than I do 3 but once
state them in the form of propositions, and there is no reason why I should
not comprehend them as well as you.]

54. 3. tamquam Heraclitus. Cicero also hints farther on in III, 14,
25 that the obscurity of Heraclitus, for which he was called ὁ σκητεινός, was
intentional; [De Fin. ΙΙ, 5, 15]. This strange idea is found also in other
authors, as in Diog. L. IX, 6. - Quod inter nos liceat. The fuller expres-
sion Ad Attio. II, 4, 1: quod inter nos liceat dicere,· [comp. ξ 59, bona
venia me audies]

54. 4. speeies ut: sit for ut esse statuatur. Comp. note to 9, 21. 275⁷

54. 5. nihil concreti δια, nothing solid (in contrast to liquid, see con-
crescere ΙΙ, 10, 26); nihil solidi, nothing solid, massive (in contrast to sost,
pliable): nihil expressi, nothing stamped in tangible‚ perceptible form;
nihil eminentis, nothing distinctive. For the genitive see Zumpt Gr. §433.

54. 7. in Venere Coa„ i.e. in the famous picture of Apelles, which
represented the goddess as ἀναδυομὲνη,

54. 10. similitudines rerum esse for sunt: transition from orat.
rect. to orat. obliq. In the next section for nec esse humana ἃς. he might
have said nec sit, continm'ng the dependence on quod.

54. 10. [Fac id . . . mihi esse persuasum; “Suppose me to be
persuaded of that which cannot even be comprehended.’' id is to be taken
with persuasum]

54. 19. Primum quidque, ‘⁶ each one in its order ”; that is, always ΤΙ
taking the object which for the moment stands at the head of the others.
The proper explanation of this often misunderstood expression is given by
Giese‚ note to Cic. De Div. Ι, 57, 127 ; and Madw'g De Fin. note, p. 321.

54. 26. deos ipsos. Comp. Plut. De Is. et Osir. c. 71: οὶ τὰ χαλκᾶ
καὶ τὰ γραπτὰ καὶ λίθινα μὴ μαθόντες μήδ’ ἐθισθέντες ἀγάλματα καὶ τιμὰς θεῶν,
ὰ7].ᾶ θεοὺς καλεῖν. In Cic. De Div. in Caec. c. 1, 3 the Sicilians complain:
sese iam ne deos quidem in suis urbibus ad quos confugiant luthere, quod
eorum simulacra sanctissima C. Verres e delubris reltgiosissimis abstu-
lisset.

54. 30. videbatur. For the imperfect see Schoemann Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ,
