demonstrative refers to the ideas of sapientia, beatitudo, aeternitas con-
tained in the preceding adjectives. =See above 1, 29, 80.

85. 13. urguet angustius, “passes on with a closer, more concise
reasoning toward his result.’' L'rguere denotes the emphatic persistence
in an assertion or an argument by which the assent of others is compelled.
So De Fin. IV, 48, 77: urguent tamen et nihil remittunt, where Cicero
is speaking of the argumentation of the Stoics by which they tried to com·
pel assent to their proposition: omnia peecata parim—The following
argument of Zeno is also found in his own words in Sext. Emp. IX, 101.

85. 20. modulate, “melodiously,” with melody ; numerose, ·‘ rhyth-
mically.’'

85. 24. fidem, Baiter 11, item.]

85. 28. dixeram. For the pluperfect see Haase's note to Reisig, p.
504; Jahn on Orat. 29, ion—motu suo, i.e. motu proprio ,· it is αὺτο-
κὶνητον, not set in motion or activity by anything external to itself.

86. 2. [extincto calore occidimus ipsu ipsi, “we ourselves,” as
distinguished from calor, the vital principle. So farther on he says eam
caloris naturam vim habere in se vitalem]

86. 3. Quod quidem Cleanthes . . . docet, quanta vla lusit. A
sort of epexegesis similar to that noticed in 1, 15, 38; for here also the
relative refers to what precedes as objectos docet, the same idea being
afterwards repeated in another form, quanta vis insit. Comp. De Fin. 11,
4, 12 : Quod vestri quidem vel optime disputant, nihil opus csse eum, qui
ficturus sit philosophus, scire litteras: Corn. Nep. Attic. c. 18: magistratus
eorum non amplius quinis versibus descrt'ltsit, quod vix credendum sit,
tantas res tam breviter potuisse declarari ‚· comp below c. 37, 93, and sur-
ther Jahn on Orat. c. 16, 52. The frequent combinations quod si (above
c. 1, 3, below 11, 38, 96), quod cum, quod quoniam and the like have
sprung from this form of expression, although a freer use often obscures
the origin.

86. 5. quin is. Comp. note ΙΙΙ, 13, 34.

86. 6. venae et arteriae. The second expression serves to specisy
the first, sor it is only the arteries, not the veins, that beat3 but vena is
very osten used in a gener-ic sense including also the arteries ; and hence
one may say venae micant, venas tangere and the like, though Gellius
XVIII, 10 censui-es this as a loquendi imperitia. Comp. note 55, 138. —-
[quum eor . . . palpitat-ot is a cui-ious form of expression ; we should
expect ita mobiliter palpitare with quum . . . evulsum in the form of an
