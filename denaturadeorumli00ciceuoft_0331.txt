the same passage fenestrae animi, as in Lactant. De Opis. D. c. 9, 2 : mens
oculis tamquam fenestris ulitur.

ἀναιρεῖ,

139. 34. quo hacc regantur. The pronoun hacc, though not rescr—
ring grammatically to caelum, denotes ‘⁴ all tlte-sc lltt'ngs,'' i.e. the universe,
which we unavoidably think os when we regard the heavens. Comp. 11,
2, 4 where hacc logically includes more than caelum caelestiaque just
preceding.

140. 3. istum potius quam Capitolinum. Cotta is quite right herc; 11
the unthinking multitude formed their ideas os the gods from the pictures
and statues they saw about them, and connected these together in the
closest manner; so much was this the case, that they in some degree divided
a deity according to the different temples and representations into different
persons, which might even be jealous one of another. It once happened
to the Emperor Augustus (only in a dream it is true), that the Jupiter
Capitolinus complained of the more zealous adoration which was paid to the
Jupiter Tonans. Suet. Aug. c. 91 ; Dion Cassius LIV, 4; Catull. XIX,
20 represents one Priapus quarrelling with another.— In quisquam nos-
trum however Cotta without doubt says too much. There were many
people who, although they did not share the views of the philosophers,
did not follow the common multitude; and who, although conceiving of
the gods as similar to men and under human forms, still regarded their
proper essence and their divine power, their ἐνέργεια, numen, not as lirn-
ited and confined in these forms, but as pervading a wider sphere accord·
ing to the office and power os each; they imagined the numen of Jupiter,
for instance, as dwelling in the aetlzer and like this pervading the whole
universe: τοπικῶς μὲν οὖν πανταχοῦ τὸ θεῖον ὑπονοεῖν ἄτοπον· ταῖς· μέντοι
ἐνεργείαις πανταχοῦ εἶναι ἀνάγκη, These words of Philoponus (in Lobeck
Agl„ p. 913) represent pretty nearly the general view of thinking people.

140. 5. quos . . . ne animantis quidem. This refers to the heav-
enly bodies which the Stoics held to be gods. 11, 15.
