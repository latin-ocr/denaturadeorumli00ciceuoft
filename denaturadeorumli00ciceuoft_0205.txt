logne bearing his name as giving his views about God and the creation
of the world; and it is undeniable that much of the Pythagorenn doc-
trine, which may really have been taught by Timaeus, is contained in that
dialogue. IIence Platonis de Timaeo deum here is equivalent to de
Timaeo acsepmm, “the god of Plato, that Timaeus taught him.’⁷ It is
generally considered that the extant treatise π. ψυχᾶς· κόσμου καὶ φύσιος
bearing the name of Timaeus is a coinparatively recent sorgery.

38. 10. anum fatidicam. Cicero (loubtless found this sarcastic ex-
pression in some of his Greek predecessors. Plutarch repeats the same,
De Nobil. c. 13: ἐκείνη ἡ ὑμετέρα πρόνοια,“ χρησμοὶ,ύ>ος >pai-g. Velleius
moreover misrepresents the Stoic view in speaking of the Pronoea as an
individual person, and he is therefore corrected by Balbus below ΙΙ, 29,
73·

38. 11. mundum ipsum. The Stoics considered the universe as
God, in so sar that they held it to be endowcd with a soul, and to be per-
meated if not by an immaterial, yet by a thinking and willing principle,
namely the siery ether, just as the human body is by the soul; the doc-
trine is developed in detail in the second book c. 8 ff. Compare note to
c. 14, 37.

38. 12. ardentem, because of the fiery ether just mentioned, ardor
caelestis,· comp. c. 14, 37; 11, 11, 30. 31; 12, 323 15, 41.

38. 14. quibus enim oculis [animi]. Velleius soresees and meets
the objection that it might be seen is not with the bodily, at least with the
mind's eye. “ With what sort of mind's eye ? ‘⁷ he asks, not being willing
to concede anything of the sort. Comp. mentis oculi, De Orat. ΙΙΙ, 41,
163 and Orat. c. 29, 101,pecl0ris oculi. Ovid. Met. XV, 64. φρενὸς ὀμμα,
Aristoph. Av. V, 1376. τὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ὄμμα, Plato Rep. VH, p. 533 D,
and Stallbaum's note—In the present passage animi is wanting in
several Mss. and is also considered as suspicions by critics.

38. ¹7. tanti muneris, i.e. tanti operis. The two expressions are
united in Cicero Tusc. 1, 28, 70: moderator tanti operis et muneris,- and
below ΙΙ, 35, 90: architectum tanti operis tantique muneris. Alanus is
especially used of public buildings, as temples or theatres, constructed at
private expense.

38. ¹9· illae quinque formae. Plato in the Timaeus, p. 53 C, ξ 107
ff. in conformity with the Pythagoreans (comp. Plutarch Plac. Phil. II, 6)
derives the so-called four elements from the geometrical shaping os the
forinless matter, which he calls, not iOJJ, but only χώρας namelv, the
earth from the cube‚ water from the icosahedron, air from the octahe-
dron, fire from the pyramid, to which is added a fifth from the dodeca-
hedron, the nature of which he does not clearly explain. Later writers
