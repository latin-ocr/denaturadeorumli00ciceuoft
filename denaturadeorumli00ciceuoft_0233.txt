49. 23- Phuo noster. See c. 3, 6. Although it cannot be stated with
certainty, yet it is very probable that Cicero here attributes to Cotta what
was really true of himself. Also c. 28, 793 33, 93.

49. 30. [bona venia me audies, excuse me for saying so, tle. sor the
use os the cpithets tam levis, tam ineptas]

49. 33. [in physicis. Under this head the ancients brought the ques· 60
tion of the existence of the gods]

50. 5. Simonide, the famous lyric poet from Ceos, who, like his 22
somewhat younger contemporaries, Pindar, AEschylus and his nephew
BacchylideS, lived often and for along time at Syracuse at the court of
the elder Hiero. With what is said of him here comp. what Tertullian
Ad Nat. ΙΙ, 2, p. 183 Oehl. says of Thales: Thales illilcsius Croeso scisci·
tanti, quid de deis arbitraretur, post aliquot deliberandi commeatus nihil
renuntiavit.

50. ιο. quid dicit, quod . . . esset. Sit would have been more cor· 61
rect; butas the preceding dicitis used irregularly (though the assertions
of Epicurus may be considered as present and still subsisting in his
writings or in tradition), Cicero might properly use esset in the rela-
tive clause, just as if dixit had preceded in the principal one. Similar
examples may be found above c. 15, 39 (fluerent atque manarent), ibid.
40 (appellarent), ΙΙΙ, 28, 70 (uterentur); others may be found in Reisig,
Haase's note No. 500; and Madvig, Cic. De Fin„ p. 464.

50. 13. [difficile est negare. A proposition to be answered in the
next sentence.—in contione, zsse. before a public assembly, on grounds
of public policy; but there is no difficulty in denying the proposition in
huiusmodi sermone, in a familiar conversation among ourselves]

50. 14. consessu. [Schoemann reads in consessu and says]: if the
preposition is allowed to stand here, we must assume that some word like
lzoc or tali has fallen out before consessu.

50. 15. ego ipse . . . is. The repeated reference by the demonstra-
tive pronoun serves to bring out the contrast more plainly. Coxnp. note to
ΙΙΙ, 39, 93. [The pronoun is here repeats the subject ega, of the first
person ; it refers in sense to pontifex and qui . . . arbitror .· “ as pontifex,
and as holding the opinion Sne. (qui . . . arbitror), under these circurn-
stauces (is) I should desire ’⁷ ἃς. It is used with reference to the first or
second person only where it has the force of talis. Cic. Phil. II, 30, 76:
qni magister equitum fuisse libi viderere . . . is per nnmicipia coloniasque
Galliae . . . cum Gallicis et lacerna cucurristi. The usage is to be distin-
guished from that referred to by Prof. Schoernann in ΙΙΙ, 39, 93. XVhere
