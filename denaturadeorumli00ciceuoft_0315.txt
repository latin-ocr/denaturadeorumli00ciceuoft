would not have continued quae . . . constituit, but qui constituerunt. Per-
haps he really wrote ab ea, i.e. a naturae providentia.

124. 9. humo excitatos Sic. comp. De Leg. 1, 9, 26: nam cum
ceteras animantes (natura) abiecisset att pastum, solnm hominem erexit,
ad caelique quasi cqgrnationis clomiciliique pristini conspectum excitavit.

124. 11. ex terra homines . . . ex terra, standing at the beginning,
properly goes with spectatores in the second member which Cicero had in
mind on commencing the sentence, though he inserted sor the sake of
contrast the negative member, non ut incolae.

124. 19. [in] sublime3 see note c. 16, 44.——iudicium magnum 141
earum est, “their judgment is of great importance.‘’ Comp. c. 58,
146; De Orat. III, 59, 222: oculorum magna est moderatio, is of great
significance.

124. 26. omnesque minimos . . . adpulsus, “ all, even the slight-
est impressions.’' Comp. above I, 24, 67: omnibus minimis temporum
punctis ,· ΙΙΙ, 35, 86: omnia minima curant,· De Fin. V, 29, 88: nec
ullo minimo momento.

124. 32. primum . . . saepsit3 quas primum perlucidas feeit. 142
Sed lubricos oculos J‘ecit corresponds to the first primum ,· firmas autem to
the second. The use of primum twice in this way is a fault which might
have been avoided with more care.

124. 34. ut continerentur. It is a little doubtful what the subject
of this verb is, oculi or membranae. It comes however to the same thing;
for the membranae, which Cicero means, are the exterior parts of the eye
itself, the cornea. By means of its hardness and stifsness it maintains its
form (continetur) so as not to be dispersed or put out of place.

125. 1. pupula, also pupilla, the pupil, Gr. κόρη, of the picture which
is represented in it ; ἑν ῳ’ τὺ εἱδωλον ἀντιλάμπει τοῦ βλέποντος, Plutarch De
Fac. in Orb. Lun. c. 27.

125. 8. et somno coniventibus etc. The reading of the Mss. in this 143
passage contains so gross a violation of grammatical construction that it is
difficult to believe that Cicero really wrote it so. After coniventibus,
whether taken as abl. abs· or dat„ a clause ought to follow with some other
subject than oculi ,· such is not the case, but instead of it comes utque
quiescerent. Nothing can be made of this utque, or ut qui as some Mss.
have it; it must have crept in through an oversight. But the copyists,
misled by the preceding apertis, have written coniventibus instead of coni-
ventes (coniventeis) sc. oculi, as Cicero wrote; in this way we gain the
necessary subject to quiescerent. In the intervening sentence quam . . .
egeremus the pronoun eis would have been enough. The use of the sub·
