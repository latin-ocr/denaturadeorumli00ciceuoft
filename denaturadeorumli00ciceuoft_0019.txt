INTRODUCI'ION. 9

Stoics is not a purely spiritual, immaterial being; it is at once
matter and spirit inseparably united. But this spiritual and nia-
terial essence nianifested itself in the creation of the world in
such a way that two modes of its activity may be distinguished.
Its material essenee, represented as the finest, tire-like ether,con-
densed itself in part to a coarser nature, and thus arose the matter
of the world, the ὕλη, at first only an ἄποιος οὐσία with no definitely
marked qualities ¹3 this matter then divided itself in gradations into
different elements, from the continual action of which each on the
other, under the influence of the law implanted in them by the origi-
nal divine being. a well ordered whole, the κόσμος, the universe
proceeded. The universe is thus an emanation from the deity, the
connection between the two still of course subsisting. We may
regard it as a body, in which the deity is present as the animating
soul. But we must not be misled into considering the deity only as
the soul of the universe3 it is rather only a part of the original deity
that is embodied in the universe23 the deity does not itself for that
cease to exist, exalted above the universe3 it is not simply imma-
nent, it is also transcendent. The divine ether mingled with no
grosser stuff encircles the world that has proceeded frorn it, from it
soul and life continually flow forth into the world, without its ever
being exhausted3 the grosser elements rather, out of which the cor-
poreal world has been formed, will all gradually be dissolved by it
and absorbed into it; the world returns to the deity, to come forth
again from it anew.3

The primaeval deity is conceived of as a sels-conscious. thinking,
willing, wise, or in other words as a personal being3 but in the uni-
verse that has proceeded frorn it there arise, as individual manifesta-
tions of the all-pervading divine ether other beings likewise sels-con-
scious, thinking, willing, hence personal beings ; and these are of two
sorts: the less perfect, laden with coarser bodies, limited to ashort life,
burdened with manifold weaknesses and defects, but still capable of
perfectiori and of wisdom3 these are mankind3 and, secondly‚ the
