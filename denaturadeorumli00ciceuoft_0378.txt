336 DE NATURA DEORUM.

that by these ablatives he only intended to characterize the simultaneous
occurrence of both these processes, i.c. the entrance of the air and the
expansion of the lungs, without thinking of the actual relation of the two
which we designate as a conditional or a causal one; the lung does not
expand is or because the air enters, but the contrary, ts or since the lung
expands the air enterS, as in a pair of bellows, with which indeed the
breathing process is for this reason compared, eg. by Aristotle De Resp. c.
21. Now it is quite possible that the matter was not quite clear to Cicero,
or that he thought it unnecessary to describe it more definitely, which it
would have been quite easy to do by writing, say trahentes spiritum. But
as little as I should be inclined to grant this, no more can I regard Mad·
vig's conjecture as free from objection. Moreover if the original text had
read thus, such an easily understood expression would hardly have become
so corrupted as the variations found in the Mss. show. But if the original
text read in respirant, the change to respiritu with or without in is ex-
plicable from the difficulty the correctors found in respiratus, just as for
example in Cic. Attic. I, ep. 18, 3 and Liv. XXX, ¹5, 3 the Mss. waver
between suspiratus and suspiritus. Orelli omitted in before respiratu ,-
as it has sufficient warrant in the Mss. 1 have thought best to leave it,
and so have not quite followed Lambinus.

II, 55, 137. consectus iam coctusque for concoctusque. See Opusc. Ac. .

III, p. 374.

11, 57, 143. ct somno coniventibus . . . utque tamquam involuti quiesce-
rent. O. Ileine in the Philolog. XV, p. 685 assumes here a gap to be sup-
plied perhaps by trgumcntum essct. Perhaps [tegumentum ess]et quo . . . ?

ΙΙ, 59, 147. [et] qualis sit (Schoemann for qualisque sit). As the
copula is wanting in the Mss. it is not improbable that the words are nothing
but a gloss to quam vim hala-at. Hence Baiter has bracketed them, as
also the preceding idque ratione, on the genuineness of which no one save
the most recent translator will believe.

11, 66. 165. Sin autem lais consulunt. Bouhier with some reason sup-
poses that Cicero wrote si autem. At least sin would not be used here in
the usual way, namely as introducing an assumption that contradicts or ex-
tends one that precedes, whether expressed or implied (see Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ,
p. 372, note 2). It is clear that neither of these is the case here, but only
a further consequence is drawn from what precedes.
