1 36 DE NATURA DEORUM.

attempts to show on the contrary that reason, since it is so often
turned to evil purposes and brings so much harm. cannot by any
possibility be regarded as a divine gift3 sor we cannot suppose either
that the gods would have given to men a hurtl‘ul gift or that they
could not have prevented or soreseen the evil use which mankind
would make of it (66-78). Gods who really wished well to man-
kind ought rather to have made them good and wise; or if not
this, they ought at least to have had a care for those who are good
and wise (79, 80). But this is no more the case than the other;
the best men often fare the worst‚ and the worst the best; expe-
rience gives no proof whatever of a divine justice, which rewards
virtue and punishes vice; and this would afford encouragement to
crime, were it not for conscience, which, regardless of the deity,
furnishes to mankind a support and gulde (81-85). But no evi-
dence of divine government is discernible here3 and the pretext that .
the gods concern themselves with human affairs only in general, not
with trifles‚ is inadmissible, because the cases in which the absence
of divine justice is felt are by no means all trifles of no impor-
tance (86). The general belief regards precisely the external
gifts of fortune, not the internal ones such as virtue and wisdom, as
coming from the gods: and thus the good fortune, which bad men
enjoy, is a proof against the divine government of the world (87,
88). Isolated instances, in which the good meet with success, are
of no weight against the majority of cases where the contrary hap-
pens3 and it is no excuse to say either that the gods do not concern
themselves with every individual case or that they are ignorant
(89, 90). And to say that the gods visit the punishment of evil
deeds, if not on the evil-doers themselves, at least upon their children
and descendants is to attribute to them the greatest injustice. But
suffering and missortune come not from any god. but from men
themselves. The deity does not protect us against it, even where
it should justly do so, if, as the Stoics say, it has the power to do
what it wills. So then the deity is ignorant of what it can do, or it
has no concern for mankind, or it is incapable of judging what is
good (91, 92). The Stoics contradict themselves, says Cotta, when
they say that the gods do not concern themselves with details, and
at the same time maintain that dreams come from the gods, and urge
every-body to pray to the deity, for in that case the deity must hear
the prayers of individuals.
