although no Stoic, says Ι-Ι. N. VII, prorem: Hominis causa videtur cuncta
alia genuisse natura ,· and the Christian Lactantius, De Ira Dei, c. 14, says:
vera est sententia Stoicorum, qui aiunt nostra causa mundum esse con-
structum ,· omnia cm'm, quibus constat mundus, ad utilitatem hominis
accommodata sunt: on the other hand Seneca more modestly and rightly
says, De Ira ΙΙ, 27 : nimis nos suspicimus, si digni nobis videmur, propter
quos tanta moveantur. [Comp. Montaigne, Essais, Liv. 11, c. 12.]

128. 28. deorum hominumque causa. Comp. above c. 6, 16. The
following phrase quaeque . . . inventa sunt is probably spuriouS, because
it contains only a gratuitous and jarring repetition of what was just said ;
moreover inventa, which can only refer to discoveries made by man, seems
out of place here where the discourse turns only on the provident care of
creative nature—The following proposition in regard to the world as a
state common to gods and men was a favorite idea with the Stoics‚ con-
stantly repeated. See especially Arius in Euseb. pr. Evang. XV, 15: ὀΑ
κόσμος οἱονεὶ πόλις ἐστὶν ἐκ θεῶν καὶ ἀνθρῦπωυ, τὼν θεῶν μὲν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν
ἑχόντων, τῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ὑποτεταγμένων· κοινωνίαν δ’ ι’·πάρ χειν πρὸς ἀλλή-
λους διὰ τὸ λόγου μετέχειν, ῦς ἑστι egli-oft νόμος. Comp. Cic. De Leg. I, 7,

’ 23 ; De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 19, 64. In the Herculanean Fragment Col. IV, 22 it is

ascribed to Chrysippus, in the third book περὶ φίπεως.

129. 2. ad mundi cohaerentiam. See note to c. 32, 82.—tamen
et spectaculum . . . is not sor ctiam spectaculum, but points to some-
thing which Cieero was about to add in opposition but afterwards forgot,
or at least does not bring in the corresponding form. Ile might have said:
et magnam hominum vitae utilitatem aſj‘erunt .· eorum enim cursus dime-
tati ἃς. As it is, this last proposition, introduced by enim, follows as a
proof of the remark immediately preceding in regard to the regularity
and ingenious adaptation obscrvable in the movements of the heavenly
bodies. For it is just this which has made it possible for mankind to
measure time rightly.—The words ad rationem sollertiamque prae-
stantior are not to be interpretcd by supplying incitandam, as is the
question were of arousing the reflection and inventive power of man
by the observation of the heavenly bodies. praestans ad aliquam rem
means : “excellent in regar-<l to (on account of) something''; as in De
Leg. ΙΙ, 13, 33 ε multa ad veritatem admirabilia: “ prophecies wonder-
ful in regard to their truthsulness”; Pro Fontei. 15 : vir ad usum et dis·
ciplinam peritus, ad casum fhrtunamque felix .· ‘⁴ an experienced man as
regards practice and knowledge, a lucky one as regards chance and for-
tune.” —On insatiabilior see note c. 39, 98.
