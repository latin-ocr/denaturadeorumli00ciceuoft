would have been more correct. See however note to c. 22, 61. For the
subject-matter comp. 11, 33, 84 and Ps. Plutarch De Plac. Phil. 1, 9:
οἱ Στωϊκοὶ τρεπτὴν καὶ ἀλλοιωτὴν καὶ μεταβλητὴν καὶ ῥευστὴν ὓλην δι’ ὑλωυ
τὴν ὓλην. Bouhier has proposed manerent instead of manarent on ae-
count of terram ,· which is of course inadmissible. Heindorfs suggestion
is better 3 ut aquam et αένα ,· tum solem, lunam, sidera, terram διε. The
words qua omnia continerentur are superfluous, probably an old addition
suggested by omnia continentem above.

44. 29. etiam homines eos . . . The souls of ordinary men at death
are lost in the universal nature; those of the better sort maintain a per·
sonal existence and lead a godlike life until the general conflagration of
au things; a few of especial excellence are taken into the number of the
gods. See 11, 24, 62 and Ps. Plutarch De Plae. Phil. IV, 7; Diog. L.
VII, 157 and other passages.

44. 30. aethera . . . lovem. See II, 2, 4 and 25, 65. 4⁰

44. 31. Neptunum. See II, 26, 66 and 28, 71. Perhaps aether
would have been more correct than (ιὲν, but the Epicurean is not quite so
exact. The author of the Herculanean fragment col. 3, 2 (p. 80 Gomp.)
uses ὰὲρα even of Zeus ; and 8, 3 (p. 85) he calls the Stoic gods ἀέρας καὶ
πνεῦματα καὶ αὶθὲρας. Moreover Empedocles did not strictly distinguish
the two expressions. See Karsten, Emped„ p. 2173 and further in Schnei-
der, Callimach. Ι, p. 293 3 and Munro's note on Lucretius II, 1115.

44. 3²· terramque . . . quae Ceres. See II, 26, 67 and 28, 7¹·

45. 3. Orphei. The so-called Orphic theogony. 41

45. 4. Musaei. He is spoken of as a friend and disciple of Orpheus,
and was also said to have written a poem on thestheogony. All the cita—
tions from it are gathered in Sehoemann Opusc. Ae. II, p. 6.

45. 7. Diogenes Babylonius. He was a disciple of Chrysippus, from
Seleucia in Syria, καλοῦμενος δὲ Βαβυλώνιος dui τὴν γειτωνὶαν, as Diog. L.
says V11, 81. His book περὶ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς is also referred to Hercul. Fr.
5, 15 (82 Gomp.).

45. 12. fusa; the proper expression not only for the outflow of ἐξ
poetic or prophetie inspiration but for the utterances of delirium or
thoughtlessness. Comp. c.' 24, 66; De Fin. IV, 4, 10: poetarum more
verba ficndere ,· De Div. ΙΙ, 11, 27: concitatione mentis edi et quasi fundi.

45. 18. portenta magorum, i.e. the fantastic doctrines of the Per· 43
sian and Median religion3 their priests and sages were called magi.
(Comp. c. 8, 183 11, 28.) All that was known of their religion by the
