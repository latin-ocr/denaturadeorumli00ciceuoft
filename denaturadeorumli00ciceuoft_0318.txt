284 Nores,

as the Stoic did onc must remember that according to Chrysippus, from
whom this portion os the argument is doubtless directly or indirectly taken,
the thinking faculty resided in the breast, in the heart, and thus close to the
lungs. See Galen, De llippocr. et Plat. Dogm. 11, 3 sq„ and 111, 8. The
thought is formed here as λόγος ἐνδιάθετος and comes sorth as speech, λόγος
προφορικός, through the organs of speech.—The Mss. have percipitur
instead ospercielur [the reading in Sehoemann's text].

127. 6. finita dentibus can hardly be right. Probably it should be
munita dentibus. See Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 377.

127. 6. vocem Inmoderate profusam, the inarticulate sound ; as on
the other hand moderatio vocis is used in De Leg. I, 9, 27 sor the articula-
tion. By means of the articulation are formed the different and definitely
determined sounds, soni vocis distincti et pressi, the characteristic endow-
ment of the μέροπες ἅνθρωποι, by which they are distinguished from the
beasts of which the vox is immoderate profusa.

150 7. 13. mo es comm ssuras e ar us, e mora e, p ian con

nections and joints ”3 sor which he might have said commissuras artuum.

Artas are really the same as articuli, Gr. ἀρίὶρα, although the word is aster-

wards used for the members of the body ; mollis is originally equivalent to

mobilis, from which it is derived ; the meaning “sost ’' is only a sec·
ondary one.

151 127. 24. condita is here more probably from condere than from con-
dire. The salting and especially the conserving, condire, of alimentary
substances is usual only to a limited extent; the laying aside however,
condere, is general ; and the most important substances, the grains and
vegetables, need no conserving. Comp. too e. 62, 156 and 63, 157.

127. 25. vescimur . . . capiendo is an inexactness os expression worth
noticing, for quas capimus, alimus or quae capiuntur, aluntur.

127. 31. [ferrum eliglrnus; Mss. elicimus. So in ¹30· 26 sor reme-
dia eligamus the common reading is eliciamus. In Tusc. ΙΙΙ, § 83 stirpes
aegritudinis . . . eligendae sunt and in ΙΙΙ, § 84 fibrae stirpium . . . eligendae
sunt the reading of the Mss. eligendae is now accepted instead of the com·
mon elidendae. In Div. 11, § 149 where the common reading was super-
stitionis slirpes omnes eiciendae Madvig and Baiter adopt eligendae.
Miiller proposes to read eligimus and eligamus in our text 3 the last is in
fact the reading of Ms. A ; the former has no Ms. authority]

127. 32. venas penitus abditas. These words form the second
half of a trochaic tetrameter, and it is quite possible that not only here but
in De Offic. 11, 3, 13 Cicero had in mind a passage srom some poet. Still
the metre may have been only a matter of chance. Comp. note c. 9, 25 ;
