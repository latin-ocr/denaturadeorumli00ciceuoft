117. 4. Panaetius of Rhodes, the most distinguished of Stoic phi-
losophers of his time, vel princeps disciplinae Stoicae (De Div. I, 3, 4),
flourished about ihc. 140. -- It is evident from several notices that he de-
viated in many points from the views of the older heads os his school.

117. 4. ut . . . omnis mundus ignosceret. Heraclitus had already
held {va εἶναι κόσμον, γεννᾶσθαί τε αὐτὸν ὲκ πυρὸς καὶ πάλιν &rapui-coa:
κατά τινας περιόδους ἐναλλὰξ τὸν σι”μπαντα αἰῶνα . . . Diog. L. IX, 8. The
Stoics, like Heraclitus, held the existence of an original fiery element (the
στοιχεῖον κατ’ ἐξοχὴν according to Chrysippus in Stobae. Ecl. Ι, p. 312),
nainely the ether, which they also called stre, though they distinguished it

, from the coarser earthly fire; moreover they believed that the universe

which had originally been developed from this clement would return to it
again, and aster that come forth from it anew. Comp. Diog. L. VII, 141
who also gives the opposing view of Panaetius, namely that the world was
eternal.—Instead of ignesceret we should expect ignescat on account
of the preceding pulani. The change, on which see note Ι, 22, 61, was all
the easier because os the intervening dubitare dicebant.

117. 11. eum summa Saturni refrigeret. The planet Saturn is 119
called summa, being the extreme one of the system so sar as the ancients

ΙΙ, 8, p. 14 Gr.: Saturni sidus gelidae ac rigenlis esse naturae, multoque
ea infhriorem Iovis circulum . . . ,· lvrlium silanis, quod quidam Hercu-
lis vocant, ignei, ardentis a Solis vicinitate . . . ,· huius ardore nimio et
rigore Saturni interiectum ambobus ex utroque temperari lovem, salula-
remque fieri.

117. 13. duae Soli oboediant, tle. Venus and Mei-cury, which, as
being nearest the sun and regulated by it in their motion, are subject to it.
