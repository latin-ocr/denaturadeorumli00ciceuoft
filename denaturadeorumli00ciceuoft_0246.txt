216 NOTES.

58. 21. argumenta sententiae conclusisti [Miiller reads arg-u-
mento sententiam], “you have drawn up the arguments sor your opinion in
regular, syllogistic sorms.'’ Comp. De Fin. 111, 8, 27 ε concluduntur igitur
eorum argumenta sic,· Acad. ΙΙ, 9, 27 : quae essct conclusi arg-umenti
fides. For the conclusion of Velleius see above c. 18, 48.—The reading
of this passage is uncertain. The Mss. have argumenti sententiam, which
is possibly an error for argumenti summam. summam orationis is used
in the same signification in De Or. ΙΙ, 38, 158 and summa is confounded
with sententiae by the copyists in other passages. See Madvig De F in. ΙΙ,

31, 100.

ἓξ 58. 28. sumpsisses, “you might have assumed it,’‘ = sumere poteras
or debebas, as below ΙΙΙ, 31, 76 dedisses. See Zumpt Gr. ξ 529 Rem.;
Madvig De Fin. ΙΙ, 12, 35 ; Naeke‘s note on Valer. Cato, p. 161 ; Wagner
Virg. AEn. IV, 678.—Quid autem est &c. [Schoemann reads qut on the
ground that the question really is, not what the gradatim means, but with ’
what propriety it can be applied to the form of argument os Velleius]
On the frequent confusion see Schoemann Opusc. Ae. ΙΙΙ, pp. 305, 325.

90 58. 35. formae figuram, “the structure of the sonn” (die Bildung
der Gestalt)‚ as Lucretius says, IV, 67: veterem fhrmae servare figuram.
Forma denotes the form as shown in the general impression which it
makes, figura the structure and relation of the parts 3 the fhrma stands out
visibly 3 the inner construction enters into the figura. Hence Cicero says
in De Offic. Ι, 35, 126: fhrmam nostram ceteramque figuram,- and the
colour may also enter into the sbrma, ibid. 36, 130: formae dignitas coloris
bonitate tuenda—On the following di semper fuerunt see the Sum—
mary, p. 27. ’

59. 3. ea, qua erant forma di. The firma of the preceding clause
is repeated, as often happens, in the relative clause for the sake of greater
precision; and the use of the demonstrative ea in the foregoing need not
prevent such repetition, as has been supposed. Comp. Caes. Bell. Gall. Ι,
49, 1: ultra eum locum, quo in loco Germani consederant ,· Cic. in Catil.
111, 10, 252 in hoc autem uno bello, quale bellum ,· Pro Cluent. c. 54 init:
lex ea, qua lege: and ibid. 57, 166; De Repub. 1, 26: ad eam causam
referendum est, quae causa genuit civitatem.

91 59. 9. putamus? ‘⁴ Shall we then believe ἰ’ ” For· the indicative in
such questions see note to ξ 84.

33 59. 15. memor-lter, not as often explained “from mernory,’' but “with
good memory, correct memory'' [“mindfully’' from memor.]‚ sorgetting
nothing; see Madvig De Fin„ p. 74.
