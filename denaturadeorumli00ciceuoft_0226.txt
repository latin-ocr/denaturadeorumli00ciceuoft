198 NOTES.

Greeks and Romans is collected by Thomas Hyde, Hist. relig. vett. Per-
sar. eorumque magorum. Oxon. 1700. Further information may be
found in Duncker, Gesch. des Alterth. 11 ², p. 369 ff.

45. 19. Aegyptiorumque . . . dementiam. Velleius refers to the
worship of the sacred animals and ot' the gods appearing under the form
of animals. See c. 29, 813 36, 1015 111, 19, 47.

45. 22. venerari Epicurum. This is characteristic. The followers
of Epicurus frequently used such exaggerated expressions of reverence
towards their master and were ridiculed for it by their antagonists. Comp.
Plut. contra Colot. c. 17.

45. 26. anticipationem . . . πρόληψιν. Epicurus designated by this
term the universal ideas acquired from recollection of repeated perceptions
and comparison of the impressions made thereby, inasmuch as they precede
and form the basis of every judgment of true and false and of all further
operations of the niind; this is indicated by the following words sine
qua . . ‚potesa Comp. Sext. Empir. adv. Math. Ι, 57: οὗτε ζητεῖν οὒτε ”
ἀπορεῖν ἑστι κατὰ τὸν σοφὸν Ἐπίκουρον ᾰνευ προλήψεως. [D÷0g. L. X, 33:
τὴν δὲ πρόληψιν λέγουσιν οἱονεὶ κατάληψιν ἢ δόξαν ὀρθὴν ἦ ἔννοιαν ἢ καθολι-
κὴν νόησιν ἐναποκειμένην, τουτέστι μνήμην τοῦ πολλάκις ἔξωθεν φανέντος]

45. 30. de regula et iudicio, according to Diog. L. X, 27 περὶ κρι-
τηρίου, ὴ κανών, i.e. on the test of truth or the rule tle. ot' jurlgnient. Iri
this book Epicurus set forth his system of Logic. [See note on Ι, 5, 12]

45. 32. [Cum enim non . . . The negative belongs to the first clause,
of which sit constituta is the verb, and for que after mancat we should
use in English an adversative conjunction, hut. ad unum, “without
exception.'']

45. 35. innatas cognitiones. Cicero must have known that Epicurus
did not hold the πρόληψις to be innate‚ but to arise after the manner men-
tioned above3 hence Diog. L. X, 33 calls it μνήμη τοῦ mahir-[s φανέντος,
In using the word innatas therefore he merely indicates the natural
origin in the mind, the in animo notum, which was not clearly expressed
by insitas. Comp. note to 11, 4, 12; 17, 45. [De Fin. Ι, 9, 31: ltaque
aiunt hanc quasi naturalem alque insitam in animis nostris inesse
notionem ἃς]

46. 1. id verum necesse est. Comp. II, 2, 5; and 4, 12; per con-
tra 1, 23, 62.

46. 4. [hanc nos habere anticipationem, namely ut deos beatos ἃς.
which comes after the following parenthesis]

46. 7. quam antea nemo. The Stoics, the first of whom Zeno was
contemporary of Epicurus, used the word in a similar significatiom it
