faciundis, and to introduce in its place the popular vote. comp. Cic.
Lael. c. 25, 96, and below c. 17, 43.

138. 21. Sibyllae interpretes, i.e. the quindecimviri sacris faciun-
dis, a college of which the duty was to keep the sibylline books, to consult
them on the order of the Senate, to report thereon and to carry out the
necessary religious observances prescribed by them ; from which last duty
the title of the office was taken. They were called quindecimviri since
the year 673 (probably) ; before this decemviri, since 378; in the earlier
period dum-iri.

138. 23. Romulum auspiciis, Numam sacris. Nothing is com-
monet than this reference of the Roman auspices to their founder Romulus,
who not only was himself an excellent augur (De Div. 11, 33, 70; 38, 90,
De Repub. ΙΙ, 9, 16) and founded the state auspicato (De Repub. 11,
9, 16) but also handed down to his successors the connection between the
state and the gods thus instituted by the auspices of the foundation. The
more precise arrangement of the sacra, i.e. the religious observances by
which the gods are rightly xfi‘shipped and of the orders of priests insti-
tuted for carrying them out, is quite as osten ascribed to Numa (De Repub.

11, 14).

138. 35. Primum quidque. See Ι, 27, 77, note. μ

138. 35. et, si id est primum. The connection is as follows: si id
est primum, esse deos, id ipsum cur ila sit, nt'lcil lu me daces. But inas-
much as the double relative clause quod. . . eximi non potestis inserted
after the first member, a tamen is inserted in the second member for the
sake of the contrast; and in order to bring out distinctly the opposition
between saith and knowledge Cicero introduces here also the relative
clause qnod. . . auctoritate maiorum, which in fact only repeats what
has been said although with an addition. On eximi [which Baiter and
Schoemann read for excuti] see Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 378 sq.

139. 9. Egone? See I, 7, 16, note.

139. 17. Quam simile istud sit, tu videris; a turn of expression,
which intimates that the opponent upon closer examination would satisfy
himself of the inaptitude of the comparison. In a similar manner, Acad.
ΙΙ, 7, 19 ε Epicurus hoc viderit et multa alia ,· De Div. 11, 53, 108: vide,
quaeso, quam sint isla similia ,· nam mihi non videntur.

139. 24. duo lumina; two openings for the light, or for seeing ; just
as lumina is osten used for fenestrae.
