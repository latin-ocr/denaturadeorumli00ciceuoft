220 NOTES.

menter errat Timarchides, sed errat domestica coniectura ‚· Ad Attic. XIV,
22, 1: vereor ne nihil coniectura aberrem. With aberrare of course
a vero, a proposito is to be supplied. A complete misunderstanding of the
expression has occasioned the placing of the preposition a before con-
iectura ,· and one must then imagine that coniectura can mean tlte very
trutlz tlmt is souglzt aster,- as the latest defendet of this opinion says,
‘⁴ coniectura cum effectu '’ or “finis quo tendimus.”

62. 18. Et barbati quidem ate„ “And of a bearded Jupiter for·
sooth '' Sne. This is represented to be quite as certain as what precedes, and
with a view of weakening or destroying its soree as an argument. See
Schwarz on Hor. Tursell.‚ p. 284; Jahn on Cicero Or. c. 50‚168; and
especially Madvig Emend. in Cic. Libr. Phil„ p. 91.

62. ²4- ob aliquam utilitatem. An assertion often made, but
hardly correct, at least in this general form. The worship of animals is a
sort of fetishism, testing upon a vague feeling os a superhuman power of
nature as displayed in them, which man in an uncultivated state wonders
at and reveres. In Plut. De Is. et Osir. c. 74 the ovpssohndv is placed
along side of the ,xp-‘tdnkffi and in c. 77 animals are called αἰνίγματα τοῦ
θεοῦ. Comp. thc learned remarks of J. A. Kanne in the Introduction to
his Mythologie der Griechen‚ and Duncker, Geschichte des Alterthums I,
p. 53, 2d edition.

62. 28. volucr-Is anguis. Other authors make the same statement,
but derive the winged serpents in part not from Lybia but from Arabia,
as Herod. 11, 75; ΙΙΙ, 107; Ammian. Marcell. XXII, 15, 26. Schneider
on [Elian. Η. An. ΙΙ, 38 is of the opinion that the creatures in question are
flying lizards (the draco volans of Linnaeus). The whole matter is doubt-
less exaggerated and fabulous.

62. 28. vento Africo. For the Italians the Africus is the West South-
VVest wind, ab occidente hiberno, qui apud Graecos λίψ dicitur (Seneca
Quaest. Nat. V, 16), because it came to thern from the province Africa.
Here it must be a West wind, as Lybia lay in this direction from the
Egyptians.

62. 3²· tamen beluas Sec. Τῇε connection of the sentences shows
that this is the true construction, not concludam tamen, because ita conclu-
dam ἃς. is not opposed to, but rather follows from what goes before:
Cotta concludes thus, not although, but because he wishes to be brief. The
tamen points to a thought not expressly stated because easily supplied from
the connection, as often occurs in conversational style: Although people
laugh at the Egyptians for their worship of animals, yet the animals (and
this by way of excuse) are not considered sacred without some reason. —
