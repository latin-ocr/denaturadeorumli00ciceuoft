the murder of his colleague Drusus see c. 32, 80. Nothing more is known
of the poisoning of Metellus.

163. ι. Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily about 550, of whose 82
cruelty many incredible stories are told, a part of which are evidently in-
ventions. He was tinally put to death by the citizens of Agrigentum who
rose against l1i1n; the accounts vary as to the manner of his death. See
Beier on De offic. 11, 7, 26. — Apollodorus, tyrant os Cassandrea, the
ancient Potidaea, likewise notorious for his cruehy, was put to death after
the taking of Cassandrea by Antigonus 1.—poenas sustulit, the more
unused expression, but used by Cicero also in Cat. ΙΙ, 13, 28 (poenam sui
sceleris stff‘rat) and Pro Font. c. 17, 39 (victoriae poenas suffi'rre). Cf.
Nonius, p. 396.

163. 4. Anaxarchus of Abdera had once deeply offended the Cyprian
tyrant Nicocreon in the presence os Alexander the Great ; afterwards, when
Nicocreon had him in his power, he put him to death.

Α 163. 6. Zenonem of Elea (Velia). Cicero says of him in Tusc. 11,
22: perpessus est omnia polius, quam conscios delendae tyrannidis indi-
caret. The tyrant's name was Nearchus.

163. 9. Harpalum. The allusion is apparently to the notorious pirate, ὦ

called by other authors Skirtalos or Skirpalos, into whose hands Diogenes
himself had once fallen.

163. 17. cum ad Peloponnesum classem appulisset. This is
evidently an error ; nothing is known of an expedition of Dionysius to the
Poloponnesus. The occasion of the error was the sui-name Olympii, which
Cicero referred to Olympia in Elis. But there were temples of the Olym-
pian Jupiter in many other places, even in Syracuse where this story is
located by Aelian. V. H., I, 20.

163. 23. Epidauri. This is also an error, occasioned by the fact that
the Epidaurian temple of Aesculapius was the most noted. Valet. Max. Ι,
1, 3. who agrees with Cicero, is no authority, as he only drew his informa—
tion from Cicero. According to Athenaeus XV, 693 Dionysius also robbed
the god of his table ; the two stories are about equally probable.

164. 4. [in [tyrannidis] rogum is the reading of Baiter ΙΙ. Schoe- Ξῖ)
mann has el impunitus rogo : and Miiller leaves the Mss. reading in tyjm-
nidis rogum without attempting to amend, but thinks that Baiter is perhaps
correct. The passage is hopelessly corrupt. The last emendation that we
have seen is that of Hofmeister, Hermes XII, 516: Tyndaride in rogum.
Schoemann has the following note ι] et impunitus rogo illatus est. Τὴε

sense is: as he was unpunished during his life and his death was quite a
