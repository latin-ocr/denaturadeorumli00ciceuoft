served, were regarded only as indications whether the gods were favorable
or not to any proposed undertaking ; they were supposed, as it is expressed
in De Harusp. Resp. e. 9, to give rerum bene gerendarum auctoritatem,
a guaranty sor the successful issue; and when the praedictis augurum
are spoken of wc are to understand not prophecies of future events, but
only general assurances os a happy issue, or warnings against disaster.

So here provident is to be taken only of the care on the part of the augurs
that nothing should be undertaken against the wish of the gods as ascer-
tained by the auspices. How important their sphere of action was may be
seen from Cic. De Leg. 11, 12, 31.

131. 7. vaticinationibus, the utterances of inspired seers, like those
of the Sibylline books which passed at Rome for state oracleS, those of
the old Alarcii fratres and others. See De Div. 1, 2, 4 ; 40, 89.

131. 8. multae saepe res . . . partae. The sense is: warnings and
‘prognostics of this sort make it possible for men to attain many things
according to their desires (ex sententia), and to further their interests
(utilitates). utilitates serves to desine the general expression res. The
reading of the Mss. hominum sententia (without ex) atque utilitate is evi—
dently an error. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 378.

131. 10. sive vis sive ars sive natura3 a power bestowed hythe
gods, a skill gained by observation, or a natural gift. Comp. De Div. Ι,
6, 11: duo sunt divinandi genera, quorum alterum artis est, alterum
naturae. The first includes divination from signs, as that by the haruspi-
ces, the augurs, the astrologers and those who divined by means of the
sortes (see ΙΙΙ, 6, 14 note); the second includes the interpretation of vis-
ions, the divine inspiration, instinctus inflatusque divinus, which last is
in the present passage denoted by vis.

orbe terrarum, fronfflhe portion of the earth which we inhabit, and which,
as is said in the following section, forms a large island. There were
thought to be four of these islands, orbes terrarum, οἶκοί-μεναι, separated
by the great sea; one inhabited by Europeans and their συνοίκοις the
second in the sarne hemisphere, but in the southern half, the inhabitants
of which were called (wi-omem the third and fourth in the northern and
southern half of the opposite hemisphere, the inhabitants of which were
called περίοικοι and ἀντίποδες of the Europeans. See Cleomed. I, p. 16
and Bake's note, p. 291 ff.

131. 33. neminem nisi iuvante deo . . . The wisest and best of 165
antiquity at all times held that men needed the divine assistance in order to
