145. 14. nullum est eorum, referring to the preceding omne animal,
equivalent to omnia animalia, a constructio ad sensum. So in De Fin. lv,
20, 57: cumque omnis controversia aut de re soleat aut de nomine esse,
ult-aque carum noscitur &o-——On patibilis see note on 11, 39, 98. Cicero
uses it in passive sense, Tusc. IV, 23, 51 ; but not elsewhere.

14 5. 16. et si omne animal tale est, i.e. scrcmli cl poliendi necessi-
!ali obnoxium. This sentence with the conclusion drawn stom it is sor
the moment put in hypothetica-1 surm, to be repeated afterwards with alqui
in a positive form ; and the mortality, the divisibility and the destructibility
of all living things then follow as a matter os course. — Moreover in this
series os propositions the lirst, si nullum corpus inmortale sil Sco, seems to
be superfluous in so far that no especial application is made of it to the
mortality of the animalia ‚· is there had been, it must have been put in be·
tween the first and second proposition, somewhat in this way: ergo cum
nullum animal sil nisi corporeum, consequitur eliam animal nullum in-
mortale esse. But Cotta might omit this as a thing to be taken for granted.

145. 17. Ergo itidem. Ergo seems to imply that the divisibility is a
consequence of the serendi cl fallendi rlct‘cssl'las just mentioned, which
would hardly be granted without qualitication ; crgo then would have been
better left out. 'she opinion os some, that crgo may be equivalent to deinde,
is properly rejected. See Hand 'l'urselL 11, p. 464.—Thc following sen-
tence would be better omitted as it only repeats what has just been said.

145. 24. similiter igitur. This tgrz'turjoins the conclusion with the
preceding protasis introduced by si. So below ξ 33. Comp. De Invent.
I, 34, 69 ε quodsi melius ιςιώενιιαιιίιω- ca, quae consilio, quam quae stne
consilio adminism-antur, m'lzil ‹Infem omnium rerum melius administra·
tut· quam omnis mundus ‚⁴ consilia {gilm- mundus 1nl1111·m·slramr.

145. 24. omnia [quae sunt]‚ e quibus oum-ta constant. If Ci-
cero really wrote thus, suut cannot be taken as the verbum existentiae and
as a complete p1·edicate; for in that case amnia qnae sunt would mean
“ all that exists‚'' which is plainly not intended here: stent mus-t therefore
be taken as the copula, and the sense must bc omnia quae sunt cuncto-
rum elementa. But the strange formos expression is a very improbable
one; Cicero probably wrote: si omnia, e quihus, quae sunt, cuncta con-
stant: or the words quae sunt should be erased.

¹45- 29. Etenim omne corpus . . . This sentence does not give the

reason os what immediately precedes, but that of the proposition: muta· ¹

bilia sunl omnia.

146. 7. sentit igitur . . .duleia et amar-ai. Carneades in Sext.
Emp. IX, 139: εἰ γὰρ εἰσὶ θεοί, ζῶά εἰσιν, εὶ δὲ :Cri εἰσιν, αἰσθάνονται.
