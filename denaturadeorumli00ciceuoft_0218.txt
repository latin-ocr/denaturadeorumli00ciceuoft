190 NOTES.

41. ¹7· ad deum revocet, “refers to the divine being,’' i.e. repre-
sents them as his manifestations or actions. Parmenides treats of the
attracting and repelling forces in his poetic language under the terms
πόλεμος, νεῖκος, στάσις, ὲρως &c., of which there are traces in the frag-
ments.

41. 19. in alio, namely in Alcmaeone, ξ 27.

ἐξ 41. 20. Empedocles of Agrigentum, about the middle of the fifth
” century, set forth his views on natural philosophy, as Xenophanes and
Parmenides did, in a didactic poem, of which several important fragments
are still preserved.

41. 21. in deorum opinione for in opinione de dis, as further on,
nullam opinionem cius. So com‘cctura provinciae Verr. ΙΙΙ, 52, 121; du-
bitatio iuris pr. Caecina c. 4 ; oratio falscie legationis and other examples
in Heinrich ad Cic. fr.; or. pr. Flace. p. 94 and Reisig's Vorles. ed.
Haase, p. 650.

41. 21. Quattuor enim naturas, i.e. the so-called four elements‚
called στωιιμὶα since Aristode, but designated by Empedocles in his poem
περὶ φύσεως as vocalia τῶν πάντων ῥιζώματα ; they are also personilied as
divine beings and called by mythological names of gods, which how-
ever may be considered as a poetic license, such as we often find in
Lucretius. Velleius evidently makes more of it than Empedocles intended.

41. 24. Protagoras of Abdera, contemporary of Socrates, was one of
the most distinguished among the so-called sophists, men who at that time
travelled about as teachers of knowledge and taught sor money. He
maintained that there was no such thing as certain, objective knowledge,
no universally valid truth, but only subjective ideas and opinions; and he
used the same language in regard to the belief in the gods. Comp. c. 23,
63.

41. 26. Democritus, also of Abdera, a somewhat younger contempo-
rary os the preceding. On liis doctrines referred to here see more in the
note to c. 43, 120.

, 41. 27. imagines earumque circumitus for imagines circumeuntes,
a strange hendiadys, but doubtless chosen designedly to bring out more
pointedly the strangeness os the thing by the strangeness of the expres-
sion. So further on scientiam intellegentiamque nostram, the ab·
straet sor the concrete, animum nostrum scientem et intellegentem. On
the natura quae imagines fundat see note to c. 24, 66 and 43, 120.

41. 33. Diogenes Apolloniates of Apollonia in Crete, contemporary
of Anaxagoras. The air-like elementary substance, which he held with
Anaximenes (e. 10, 26), he considered not only as eudowed with living
