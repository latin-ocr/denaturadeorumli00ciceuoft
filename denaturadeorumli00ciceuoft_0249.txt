61. 3. quae sola divina natura est: “which (namely, happy and
immortal) the divine nature, and no other, is.'¹ The neuter quae refers to
both predicates beata and aeterna in the preceding clause. If there were
only one of them, for instance aelerna, the phrase would run: quod sola
divina natura est,· as in De Fin. IV, 24, 66: ul iam omnes insipientes
sint miseri, quod profecto sunt,· and in the same way the demonstrative
lzoc, ibid. ξ 65 z non tamen erat ille sapiens .· quis enim ltoc ? Comp. Livy
XXX, 30: Quod enim ego sui ad Trasimenum, id tu hodie es.—The
traditional reading of this passage, sunt for esl, is not susceptible of any
rational explanation, that is, any that suits the context.

61. 7. accedebat. The imperfect in relation to the time when the
opinion was formed (ratio docuit); reason ought to have recognized this
truth, which is such not only now, but was so at that time. Compare
below c. 35, 98 videbas, and 36, 100 habebam.— [deorum. Schoemann
reads dei, and says:] the Mss. have deo sor dei. On this see Schoem.
Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 321. Possibly the reading should be deorum.

61. 10. in rubro mari. Ἐρυθρὰ θάὶασσα, the sea to the south of Asia ἓξ
and Libya, with the Persian and Arabian gulfs. See Ps. Arist. De M und.
c. 3 and Kapp’s note and the commentator-5 on Herod. I, 1.

61. 27. quid est . . . conturbet? “How can the form alone throw 98
you into such confusion ?‘' That is, how can the prejudice or the
assumed πρόληψις in regard to the form of the gods so disturb your judg-
ment that you cling to the belief in it, while you set yourself against
other assumptions no more arbitrary than that? On conturbare comp.
Beier on De Offic. III, 10, 40.

61. 28. his . . . adiunctis . . . rationem is equivalent to llaec una
cum ratione: all these endowments belong to man, as well as reason.

61. 34. uno digito plus: “a finger too many‚'' lit. more by one
finger than one ought to have ; the ablative of measure, as sol multis parli-
bus maior quam terra (ΙΙ, 36, 92); Verr. ΙΙ, 52, 129: Siculi nonnum-
quam uno die longiorem mensem faciunt aul biduo ‚· Orat. 51, 173: versus
una syllaba brevior aut longior.

62. 7. Et eos vituperabas. Above c. 20, 53 sq. —Et for et tamen ᾗῇ
or like εἶτα in Greek with the expression of astonishment. Phil. 1, 8, 19:
Quid? lege, quae promulgata est de tertia decuria, nonne omnes iudici-
ariae leges Caesaris dissolvuntur? Et vos acta Caesaris defenditis, qui
leges eius evertitis ,Ρ Other similar examples in Horat. Tursell. De Partic.‚
p. 286, Schwarz ; and Hand. Tursell. II, p. 492.
