140. 13. Homerus . . . recens ab illorum aetate. Τὴε Tyndari-
dae were, as brothers of Helen and Clytemnestra, contemporaries of the
Greeks who fought before Troy, although they died before the war in the
flower of youth. Homer was thought by many, as by Krates and his fol-
lowers, to have lived immediately after the Trojan war; see Procl. Chres-
tom. in Becker's edition of the Scholia to the Iliad, p. 1. But Cicero in ,
another passage (De Republ. ΙΙ, 10, 18) cites the opposite opinion of
others, according to which Homer lived about thirty years before the Spar·
tan Lycurgus, whom he places a hundred and eight years before the first
Olympiad, tle. 885 ; and in Tuscul. V, 3, 7 he makes Ilomer and Lycurgus
contemporaries. The reason of his attributing the other view to Cotta is
easily seen. The passage of Homer alluded to is 11. 111, 243.

13 140. 25. (ab) A. Postumio aedem . . . dedicatam. The temple
was vowed by the dictator A. Postumius at the battle of Lake Regillus;
it was dedicated at a later time by his son. So says Livy 11, 20, 12 and
42, 5, although he says nothing of any apparition in the battle.
