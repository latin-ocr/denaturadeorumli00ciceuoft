BOOK 111.—CHA1›.XV, xvl, ξς· 30-40. 303

For the following sentence commencing with nunc autem see Rem,
P· 73·

147. 30. Qualem autem deum intellegere nos possumus ἃς. ἐξ
“ How can we form for ourselves an idea os a god without virtue ? ” For
intellegere in this signification comp. 1, 10, 25; 14, 36; 11, 21, 54. The
following argumentation is also borrowed from Carneades. See Sext. Emp.
lx, 152 ff. It simply shows however that categories, which apply very
well to men and human relations, cannot be transferred to the deity, which
Aristotle has shown in regard to the various virtues Eth. Nic. X, 8. Arno-
bius Ι, 31 says ot' God: tu es de quo niln'l dici et exprimi mortalium potis
est significatione verborum ,· quid ut intelligaris, tacendum est, atque ut
per umbram te possit errans investigare suspitio, nillil est omnino muti-
endum. And ΙΙΙ, 19: Quicquid de deo dixeris, quicquid tacitae· mentis
cogitatione conceperis, in humanum transilit ct corrumpitur sensum, nec
habet propriae significationis notam, quod nostris dicitur verbis atque ad
negotia humana compositis. L'nus cst hominis intellectus de dei natura
certissimus, si scias et sentias nz‘lu’l de illo posse mortali oratione depromi.

148. 11. piscem Syri venerantur; Derceto or Atergatis‚ a mater· 39
nal natural deity. She had not however quite the form of a fish, but ac-
cording to Diod. 11, 4: τὸ μὲν πρόσωπον ἔχει γυναικός, τὸ ‹5' ἀλλο σῶμα πᾶν
ὶχθὺος; or according to Lucian De Dea Syr. c. 14: ἡμισέη μὲν γυνή, τὸ δὲ
ὁκόσον ἑκ μηρῶν ἐς ἄκρους πόδας ἱχθίός. Dagon, the god of the Philistines,
also had the form of a fish, but the head and hands of a man.

148. 13. Alabandus and Tenes or Tenues, the mythical οἰκισταί of
Alabanda in Caria and of the island Tenedos on the Trojan coast, were
worshipped as heroes. Alabandis (or Alabandeis) is the Greek form
Ἀλαβανδεῖς. Comp. Schneider Formenlehre, p. 308, and Lachmann’s
Lucretius, p. 281 note. Below c. 19, 50 Cicero uses the Latin form Ala-
bandenses.

148. 14. Leucotheam, quae fuit Ino διε. For the sable see the classi-
cal dictionaries. Here it may be remarked that Ino and many others of the
so-called deified mortals were originally real deities, but afterwards fell to
the level of deified heroes, following the vicissitudes of forms of religion
which were gradually changed and forgotten.

148. 18. Omitto i11a; sunt enim praeclara3 “ 1 pass over the 40
next proposition (tle. that the universe is God), for it is all very excel-
lent‚'’—although not true—as we must suppose the Academic thought3
so that in the praise there is a touch of irony which would have been still
more apparent if Cotta had said: sint etiam praeclara, “it may be all very
fine so far as 1 know.’'
