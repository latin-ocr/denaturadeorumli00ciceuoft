326 DE NATURA DEORUM.

current in the mythology and the traditional worship. In their opinion
those unseen beings must be of higher reason and wisdom than mankind ;
and hence having the duty and the power os taking part in the world as
servants os the supreme God according to his will and law, and of aiding
men, the nearest related beings, in their imperfection and necessities, thus
earning their gratitude and reverence. These are the beings intended,
when the providenda deorum is spoken os, as in 11, 29, 733 and the ex-
pression denotes the participation in the government of the world which
they exercise in conformity with the supreme will ; hence it is unimportant
whether we say deorum or dci providentia. Christian theologians, who
recognized the substantial agreement os this view with the biblical doctrine
os the angels, have found fault with the Stoies sor giving the name of gods
to those servants in the divine government; still, is one calls to mind the
original meaning os the word θεός or deus, he will find nothing to criticize.
It would rather be desirable to set aside a special and distinctive name sor
the supreme being, just as in fact Zet-9 is not seldom used, though having
really the same meaning as the other.

Nor can the Stoics be reproached sor not withdrawing from the tradi-
tional polytheistic public worship. They did not wish to give their sellow
citizens unnecessary and useless ofscncc; they (lid not neglect to oppose
and correct the superstitious and unreasoning views os the people, although
they were not very adroit or successful in it. The curious etymologies and
generally forced allegorical explanations of the mythological sables, exam-
ples of which we find in Balbus's discourse and elsewhere, were evidently
not very well adapted to gain acccptance with the people.

Nor should we wonder that the Stoice, in spite os their opposition to
what was offensive in the mythological sables, found it impossible quite to
avoid many ideas upon religious subjects which they found generally prev-
alent and in which they themselves had been brought up from childhood.
To tbi„- class belongs the belief in soothsaying, in visible apparitions and
exhibitions of power of divine beings, which Balbus appeals to and uses
even as prooss of the existence of the gods. Nevertheless the Stoies‚ as
time went on, divested themselves more and more of such remnants of an-
cient superstition, which in reality had no necessary connection with the
real essence and the moral teaching os their system 3 and what Gellius XIX,
1, says of the doctrine of Epictetus cannot be denied, namely that it agreed
substantially with that os Zeno and Chrysippus

In Epictetus as well as in the ethical writings of Antoninus, of Seneca
and others we find, besides the firm and living belief in one supreme God
os the universe, the no less firm and living belief in those numerous super-
natural beings which they call sometimes gods, sometimes demons ; and
