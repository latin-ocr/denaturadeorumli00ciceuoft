saeptum, sc. locis, i.e. utero.

120. 31. aqua et sustinentur et fetum fundunt; a sort of zeug- 129
ma, sor the ablative aqua properly goes only with susn‘m·ntu›-,· with filum
fundunt it would be in aqua.

120. 34. naseuntur et educantur. Grammatically os course only 52
ova can be taken as the subject ; but the rcader naturally understands the
young ones creeping forth from the eggs.

121. 12. tota aestate; a hundred days, during the whole three summer 13⁰
months. Pliny H. N. V, 9, p. 269: Incipit (A'ilus) crescere luna nova,
quac post solstitium est, sensim modiceque, cancrum sole transeunte ,-
abundantissime autem, leonem ,· et residit in virgine iisdem quibus
accrevit modis. ln lotum aulem revocatur intra ripas in libra, ut tradit
Herodolus, centesimo die. See Herod. ΙΙ, 19.

121. 14. Mesopotamiam . . . Euphrates. The Euphrates annually
overflowed its low banks when the snow melted on the mountains of

121. 15. ludus . . . maximus. Several of the aneients, as Arrian
Ind. c. 4, expressly state that the Ganges is larger than the Indus; but the

than the Indus. Id. ibid. c. 3.—Of the inundations of this and the
neighboring rivers Strabo speaks in XV, 1, p. 692 3 but what Cicero says of
the sowing that results is not found anywhere else; and it cannot be de-
termined what the semina frumenli similia were. Strabo ibid.‚ p. 694
mentions a wheat-like grain that grew wild in the land of the Musicani
east of the Indus. Comp. besides Theophr. Hist. Pl. IV, 5: φέρει δὲ (ἡ
Ἰνδία) καὶ σπέρματα ἱδια, τὰ μὲν τοῖς χεὸρόποις (pulse) ὃμοια, τὰ δὲ τοῖς
πυροὶς καῖ ταῖς· κριθαῖς· and further on, γένος ἀγρίων κριθῶν ἑξ ὼν καὶ ᾰρτου

121. 25. ventos Etesias. This was the designation of the winds ’ἒξ
which rise at a definite time and blow continuously for a season from the
