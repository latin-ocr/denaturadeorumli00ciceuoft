Aelian. V. H. V, 14 and others state that in ancient times it was considered

was once punished with exile sor this crime. The ox was only rarely offered
in sacrifice to the gods, under particular circumstances. See Hermann
Gottesd. Alterth. § 26, 20 or Schoemann Griech. Alterth. 11³, p. 245.

τὸ δὲ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον μάλιστα παιδείνειε and the subject is treated in
detail.

130. 25. remedia . . . eligamus. [Schoem. reads eliciamus, and
says:] W'e gain from them medicinal remedies by investigation and
labor, as above c. 60, 151: e terrae cavernis serrum elicimus [for eligi-
