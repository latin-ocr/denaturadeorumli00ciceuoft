The medius locus of the universe, which is therefore also the lowest (see
c. 45, 116), is occupied by the earth, c. 36 init. 'rhat which falls upon it
from above is the various sorts of atmospheric storms ; that which rises up
from it into the higher regions is the evaporations from it; that which
moves around it is the heavens with the heavenly bodies 3 and by virtue of
these motions proceeding from, tending to, or encircling this general cen·
tre the world appears to be a coherent, uniform system, a continens unaque
natura. [The real object of efficiunt, so far as the sense is concerned, is
contained in the adjectives continentem and unam ‚· “these operations
make the continuity and unity of nature.’']

104. 22. vicissitudine eorum. The mutual transsormation of the
elements here alluded to was taught before by the older natural philoso-
phers, like Heraclitus, who called it a ὑὸὺς ἀνω κάτω, a rising and falling3
the sire (or ether) is condensed into air, the air into water, the water into
earth, the earth again becomes water, ἃς. SeneC. Quaest. Nat. 111, 103

Many propounded similar ideas, for which see Ideler on Arist. Meteor. 1,
p. 426; Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. Ι, p. 72.

104. 27. [coniunctio continetur. Such expressions are frequent:
curriculum circumscripsit, for dedit ,' terminabit modum, for ponet, faciet,-
societatem coniungere, coire for facere ἃς. See Nagelsbach Lat. Styl„

, p· 289·]

104. 30. utrumvis ut sit. See c. 46, 118. 85

104. 30. natura mundum administrari. Cicero might properly
have omitted here the epithet sentiente, as he had already expounded the
Stoic idea of nature, and the verb administrari itself indicates a designed,
intelligent government. In what follows the epithet is sometimes ex·
pressed‚ sometimes omitted.

105. 1. Etenim. The remark made c. 16 init. holds true here. 86

105. 7. seminator et sator. The Stoics call the various manifesta-34
tions of the deity in the various parts os creation 26201 σπερματικοί (see note
c. 30, 75) ; but the unity which lies behind all these and manifests itself in
them is called in the singular λόγος σπερματικὸς, as creative reason. Diog.
L. VII, 136. Cicero translates σπερματικός by seminator et sator.

105. 18. ea fortuita. For the neuter see note on c. 5, 15. 87

105. 26. solarium discriptum3 a real sun-dial, because of the lines
drawn upon it, in distinction from the solarium cx aqua, a water clock, the
etymological meaning being lost sight of. The former is also called by the
Greek name sciotherum or sciothcricon ,· the water clock is also called clep-
sydra, and was originally extremely simple, but since the Alexandrinian artist
