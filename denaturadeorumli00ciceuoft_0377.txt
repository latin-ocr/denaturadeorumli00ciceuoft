APPENDIX. 3 35

cannot be granted at all. The indefinite sense, “in all places whatever,''
is always admissible3 and there are passages where this is the only one
possible, as eg. Cic. Verrin. V, 67, 172: Omnes ltoc loco cives Romani, et
qui adsunt et qui ubique sunt, vestram severitatem desiderant. It seems
therefore an error to conclude from those other passages that the indefinite
meaning of ubique was an innovation adopted perhaps in the time of
Horace ; and this seems to me all the more improbable, since utrobique or
utrubique, which also contains ubi, occurs in Cicero and his contempora-
ries as an indefinite quite in the same way and without a preceding pro-
noun, and since in general it is a mistake to conclude from the non-
occurrence of an expression in the extant remains of these authors that
they never made use os it. Ι might have proposed ubivis instead of
ubique.

- ΙΙ, 23, 61. The praenomen (A) before Atilio, which is wanting in the
Mss., is added at the well-founded suggestion of Fleckeisen. See his
Kritische Miscellen in the Progr. des Vitzthumschen Gymnasiums, Dresden,

1864, p. 56.

ΙΙ, 5ο, 126. Baiter reads, according to Madvig’s proposal: purgantes
autem alvos ibes Aegypa'ae curantur. But inasmuch as, so far as Ι know,
all the Mss. have the active curant, and purgatione is found at least in
some although perhaps by way of conjecture only for purgante of others,
and purgantes is found in none, Ι have not felt authorized to make the
change.

ΙΙ, 54, 136. et terendo cibo et praeterea spiritu. After the preceding
omne quod accepit certainly cibo is an unnecessary and perhaps erroneous
addition. Still Ι have not omitted it for the reason that, if one should
strike out all such little irregularities which the best writer may be guilty
of, he would easily run the risk of correcting the author instead of the
copyist.

II, 55, 136. Madvig’s conjecture, intrante spiritu, is certainly so sar as
regards diplomatic criticism entirely unobjectionable, and bears witness of
the masterly skill in this department which has made him an authority,
and explains how many have unquestioningly assented to him, as Baiter
does in this passage. But since Cicero has reminded us above Ι, 3, 10, non
tam auctores in disputando quarn rationis momenta quaerenda sunt, we
may be allowed here to look a little more closely for the reason of the
thing. If Cicero had written intrante spiritu, we should have to assume
