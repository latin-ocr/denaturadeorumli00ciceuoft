338 DE NATURA DEORUM.

ΙΙΙ, 17, 43. There is certainly something wanting aster si di sunt.
Something should follow which could be regarded as an apparent reason
sor the divinity of such beings as the Nymphs‚ and then be resuted by
Cotta as not valid proof ; perhaps si di sunt quibus sacra fiunt or the like.
On ne nymphae quidem igitur see Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 380.

111, 19, 50. It seems to me nearly certain that Leontidum should be ,
read sor Leonaticum of the Mss. In regard to the name Leocorium, O.
Miiller‚ Ind. Schol. Gotting. 1840, supposes that it denoted properly a place
appointed sor the expiation of the sins of the people (λεωκόρος, aster the
analogy of νεωκόρος); Lobeck, Pathol. 1, p. 5 50, says: Suspectus est Leos
heros et omnis illa de filiabus eius fabula, sicut omnia quae de Graecorum
sacrificiis humanis tradita sunt. Nomen Leocorion vel Leoeori cuiusdam
monumentum est vel populi curiam s. λήιτον signifieat.

111, 29, 72. Instead os the Mss. parumnc semper in ratione versantu}
Baiter reads parumne saepe according to the conjecture os Madvig and
older critics, which does not seem to me necessary. It is clear enough that
parum semper cannot be united; but parum should be taken with the
following in ratione versantur, which is required by parumne subtiliter
disputat coming directly aster. It need not surprise one that it is separated
from it by semper ‚· there is a good reason for the position. Semper points
to the fact that the levitates comicae are not always committed, though they
may osten be so, without ratio, without a sort os reasoning to justisy them.

ΙΙΙ, 31, 77. Et si verum est ἃς. Baiter, aster Madvig, reads Ut si
verum essct . . ., brackets the words si, qui audierunt to intetpretarentur
as a spurious interpolation, and makes the apodosis to the protasis com-
mencing with ut begin in ἓ 78 with sic, si homines. . . There is no doubt
that Cicero might have written thus, and that it might have been better
had he done so ; but it does not seem to me necessary for that reason to
change the traditional reading of the Mss. What is best is not always
genuine, and slight inaccuracies are easier to excuse in a treatise which
evidently affects the sreedorn of an extemporary conversation. We may
therefore excuse the repetition of the protasis in si, qui audierunt δὶα,
and the separation os prorsus of the apodosis from its verb tacere. Mad-
vig thought it necessary to change the si verum est to si verum esset be-
cause, according to his conjecture, only these words could form the protasis
to tacere praestaret ,· with the common reading this is unnecessary because
the protasis is contained in the clause si . . . essent discessuri. It is incredible
that this clause merely repeats in hypothetical form the thought expressed
at the beginning in more positive form by si verum est &ej—‘I have
