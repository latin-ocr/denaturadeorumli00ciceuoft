Introduction, page 9. We are justified in ascribing personality to the
original deity of the Stoics because he is endowed with consciousness, will
and wisdom; and we cannot conceive these attributes as existing indepen-
dently of a personal being. But the Stoie deity is not on the one hand
simply iinmanent in the universe, like that os a one-sided pantheism; nor
on the other a blind natural force, the uncomprehended soree os atheism:
he pervades the world, but is not lost in it and still remains exalted above
it. Of course there is no question os an absolute personality in the case
of this deity, partly above the world, partly immanent in it, in fact the two
ideas os the personal and the absolute are irreconcilable ; and the longer
we meditate on the nature and attributes of the deity, the more surely shall
we come to the conclusion of Arnobius whose words are cited in the note
to 111, 15, 38.

That the Stoics were unable to conceive of the deity as a purely imma-
terial being will perhaps not seem unpardonable even to those who hold
the opposite opinion ; and so much the less will they be blamed sor con-
eeiving of the matter of the divine being as ether, the source of light and
heat, since they were neither the first to hold such a view, nor have there
been wanting even in recent times men of the greatest honesty and relig-
ious feeling who thought as they did.

Introd, pp. 11, 12. In Book ΙΙ, 6, 16 the Stoic says: Etenim si di non
sunt, quid esse potest in rerum natura homine melius? in eo enim solo est
ratio, qua nihil polest esse praestantius. Esse autem bominem, qui nihil
in omni mundo melius esse qutzm se putet, desipisnlis adroganliae est:
crgo est aliquid melius ,· est {gitur profecto deus. The Stoics rightly thought
it incredible that in this world emanated from the original deity man should
be the only being endowed with reason except the heavenly bodies, the
simple aspect of which seemed to show their etherial nature, and their won-
derful and regular movements to prove their intelligence. They found
in the popular religion a belief in the existence of other beings of a
higher grade than man, although they could not assent to the conceptions
