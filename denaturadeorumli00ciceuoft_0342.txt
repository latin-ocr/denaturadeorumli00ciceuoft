148. 30. qui illud, quo vescatur, deum eredat esse. But no more
was this an opinion os the Stoics ; see note on 11, 23, 60.

148. 31. Nam quos . . . The corresponding demonstrative is omitted.
It might be supplied: de llis lu reddes rationem. [Schoem. has reddas]

148. 34. in monte Oetaeo ἃς. The reference is to Hercules. It is
not known in what play the quotation was sound; perhaps in the Philoc-
tetus.

149. 2. Homerus. Od. xl, 600. The passage is among the interpo-
lations os the Xer-via,

149. 5. ii, qut interlores scrutantur et reconditas litteras.
Doubtless the same who in c. 17, 44 are called genealogi, in 21, 53 theologi,
in 22, 55 antiqui historici, i.e. learned students of mythology of the Alex·
andrinian epoch, who, observing the mass os contradictory and clashing
sables that were current about all the gods, hit upon the rather simple ex-
pedient of imagining several gods of the same name in order to reconcile
the inconsistencies. Comp. Schoein. OpuSC. Ac. Ι, p. 324. “

149. 8. Lysithoe is elsewhere mentioned only by Joaan. Lyd. De Mens.
1V, 46, p. 82 Bonn., where she passes sor a daughter os Oceanus. She is
probably the same as Lysillzea mentioned by the same author c. 38, p. 72
as mother of Dionysus. Dionysus and Hercules were often identified by
later writers.

149. 9. concertavisse cum Apolline de tripode. On the sable of
Hercules robbing the Pythian tripod see especially Miiller, Dorier‚ B. 11, ’
11, 8.

149. 10. Nilo natus Aegyptius. In the Aegyptian mythology there
was a god Som or Dsom whom the Greeks from some similarities con-
sidered as identical with their Heracles. See Jablonski Panth. Aeg. I, p.
184 ff.; Parthey on Plutarch De Is. et Osis„ p. 210 ff.

149. 10. Phrygias litteras. It is ‹lisficult to say what is here meant.
Perhaps, as Wyttenbach thinks (note to l‘lut. De Is. et Osir., p. 362), cer-
tain written characters which were supposed to possess mysterious power,
and written on tablets or leaves were used sor amulets, as nowadays hap-
pens in the East. Or they rnay have been what was generally called
Ἐφέσια >pausia-ra, formulas sor exorcism, which according to some were
devised by the Phrygian dactyli. Clem. Alex. Strom. 1, 15. Comp. Lobeck
Agl„ p. 370 and 1163.

149. 11. ex idaeis digitis, Greek, Daczvlis. These originally be·
longed to the Phrygiam mythology. They were sabulous beings in the train
os the mountain goddess Cybele, acquainted with magic arts and inventors
of working in metal‚ which men learned from them. They were in later
times transferred to the Cretan Ida. Five os them are generally men-
