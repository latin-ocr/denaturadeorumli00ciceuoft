that noticed above. Cotta pretends not to know that all the arts are only
especial developments or applications of the general power which the
Stoics ascribed to the universe, and that it is illogical to transfer to the
universal power what can only arise from its subdivision.

143. 23. [et quidem has the Mss. authority. Schoemann and Baiter
I and ΙΙ read alque idem. The saine Mss. have cl quidem in 11, ξ 41,
which Schoeinann there retains, but Baiter 1, ΙΙ changes to atque item. et

seems to be no reason for deviating from the Mss——MtiHer does not

143. 32. Quid Chalcidico Euripo . . . constantius? There were
probably other opinions about this, sor the irregularity of the currents in
the Euripus was proverbial. Comp. Plat. Phaed„ p. 90 C. Diogenian.
Prov. 111, 39; lv, 72. There is however in this irregularity a regular
movement as Babin explains in Spon’s Reisen &e translated by Menudier ’
ΙΙ, p. 62. Comp. Ideler on Aristot. Meteor. 1, p. 599 and Ulrich's Reisen
in Griechenland 11, p. 220.

143. 34. freto Siciliensi. Pomp. Mel. 11, 7: id angustum et anceps
alterno cursu modo in Tuscum modo in lonium pelagus perfluit.

143. 35. Europam Libyamque . . . The quotation is srom an un-
known poet, perhaps Ennius in the Annals ; it is cited also in Tusc. 1, 20,
45. The fretum Gaditanum is meant.

144. 1. aestus maritimi . . . See note to ΙΙ, 7, 19.

¹44- 8. confugitis ad deum. But whoever says that these things are
ordered by nature working blindly and unconsciously (see ΙΙ, 32, 81 note)
no inore gives an explanation of them than he who sees in thern the work-
ing of a divine law. Can one be proved any more than the other ? Cotta
promises to bring the proof (quem admodum docebo, at the end os the
chapter) ; but the passage in which he attempted it is lost.

144. 16. in eodem . . . errore versantur, it rests upon the same
error. Tusc. 1, 44, 107: vides quanto llaec in errore versentur. Comp.
lVopkens Lect.Tull.‚ p. 77. The expression is generally used in speaking
of persons.

mcli1cs?‘' Cf. ξ 21; Sed cum mundo negas quicquam esse melius, quid
dicis melius ? Sco]

144. 30. At enim quaerit . . . Socrates. See ΙΙ, 6, ¹7-
144. 31. Et ego quaem, unde orationem . . . To judge of this
objection see note on c. 9, 23.
