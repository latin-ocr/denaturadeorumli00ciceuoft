sanctitas, rellglo. Pietas is pure, dutisul feeling towards those m'th
whom we stand in intimate connection, our relatives, colleagues in office,
our superiors; especially then towards the gods as our governors aud
benefactors. In 41, 116, it is described as iustitia adversum deos ,· and in
the same place sanctitas is called scientia colendorum deorum ,· (see also
the note). Sanctitas is properly irreproachable behavior towards the
gods; reltjgio the recognition of the duty by which we seel ourselves
bound (De Invent. ΙΙ, 5 3, 161 : quae superioris cuiusdam naturae, quam
divinam vocant, curam caerimoniamque affero: and to this idea the
derivation from relzgrare given by Lactantius IV, 28 appears to correspond
better than that of Cicero, from relegere, given below II, 28, 72.

does not however prevent Cicero from emphasizing the idea by the added
epitheton.——-Moreover the remark has particular reference to the Epicu·
reans, who, although disbelieving in a divine power that governs the
world, yet endeavored to keep up an appearance of divine reverence. See
below, ch. 17, 45 3 21, 563 and on the other side, 41, 115.

33. 20. fides . . . iustitia tollatur. Cicero also points out the con-
nection between the duties towards men and the duties towards God
in ΙΙ, 61, 153; but a passage cited by Lactantius V, 8 from the De
Legibus refers to the ground of this connection, namely, that the con-
sciousness that all nien are os the same (divine) race and are in the same
way the object os the divine love and care must produce among them too
a mutual regard and love. So in De Offic. III, 6, 28 disregard of one's
duties to his sellow-men is brought forward as a proof of impiety towards
the gods. Compare also below II, 61, 153 and Gataker on Antonin. 11,
1, p. 43. XVyttenbach has observed not without reason that the clause
beginning atque haud scio would be in a more proper place before the
preceding quibus sublatis. In its present position it seems only an after-
thought‚ to make an application of the preceding general observation to
the living together of men in society. A radica} criticism might be dis-
posed to throw aside the whole clause as an interpolation; one less severe
to substitute namque for atque. [But is not the clause haud scio an a
reinforcement of the preceding? Cicero has just said that, if sam-mas
and religio are taken away, great trouble ensues in common 1ife; but if
you take away pietas adversus deos, loyalty towards the gods, it would be
almost impossible for rnen to live together in society]
