BOOK 1.-cm1›. xr. §5 27, 28. 189

41. 8. Xenophanes, born at Colophon, was banished from there, and
emigrated to the Phocaean colony os Elea in lower Italy; he was contem·
poraiy with the Persian wars and founder of the Eleatic school.

41. 8. mente adiuncta omne praeterea, quod esset infinitum Sec.
Construed thus the sense must almost necessarily be, that Xenophanes
understood the mens and besides (praeterea) the infinite All as two dif-
ferent things, but still as subsisting in union, and that he called them both
together God. Is Velleius really meant this, it was certainly an error and
in contradiction with what we know os Xenophanes from other sources.
Ι have therefore taken the liberty to change the traditional punctuation,
writing omne, praeterea quod instead of omne praeterea, quod ἃς. Itis
certain that praeterea quod might have been said as equivalent to praeler-
quam quod, though there may be no other example of it. The sense of
the passage would then be: that Xenophanes taught that the Omne,
endowed with intelligence, was not only infinite, but was also God. [We
have retained the usual punctuation in the text]

41. 10. item, ut ceteri, like Thales for example (c. 10, 25) and
Anaxagoras (c. Η, 26).

41. 11. neque sentiens neque coniunctum. Xl'hatever is infinite
cannot be touched by an)‡hing outside of itself, and hence cannot expe-
rience sensation (see note to ξ 26) nor stand in connection with any·
thing, because outside of itself there is nothing.

41. 12. Parmenides of Elea, disciple of Xenophanes, set forth doc-
trines such as are here cited in the second partos his didactic poem, in
which he treated, not as in the first part περὶ τοί- orwig, i.e. of that which
really exists, but περὶ τῶν αἰσθητῶν, of phenomena; and set up a sort of
scientific dogmatism (τὰ πρὸς δόξαι),

41. 13. coronae simile. In the world sprung from the elementary
substance Parmenides assumed the existence of a number of concentric
spheres, which he called στεφάνας-ε τὴν δὲ μεσαιτάτην άπάσαις τοκέα καὶ
κλῃδοῦχον ἐπονομάζει, δίκην τε καὶ ἀνάγκην, Stobae. Ecl. I, p. 482. Comp-
the verse of Parmenides preserved by Simplicius, Phys. f. 9 a: ὲν δὲ μέσῳ
τοίη-ων δαίμων, ῆ πάντα κυβερνᾷ. In taking the exterior sphere of all for
the abode of the δαίμων instead of the middle one Velleius confounds the
views of Parmenides with those of the Stoics‚ On this see e. 14, 37 ; and
comp. Somn. Scip. c. 4.

. 41. 13. continente ardore, i.e. continuo, perpetuo. Comp. Curt. VII,
20, 2: continenti incendio cuncta torrentur. — lueis orbem = orbem
lucidum.

41. 16. monstra, also used of fantastic views, absurdities in 111, 17,
443 like portenta, 1, 8, 18; 16, 43; and ΙΙΙ, 38, 91.
