[“ The distorted conceptions of the Platonic doctrines, which we find
here, are not to be laid to the charge of Cicero, but to that of some Greek
authority of the Epicurean school, who, it would seem, designedly sor his
own purpose expounded the Platonic teachings and in part misrepresented
them.'' R. Kiihner, Wesen der Gotter, iibers. u. erkl„ p. 64]

31 42. 10. [Atque etlam here and below ξ 32 serves only to make the
transition. It is worth while to notice the different particles used for this
purpose throughout the whole passage from ξ 25. Compare a similar
one, 11, 47, 122.]

42. 12. formam dei quaeri non oportere. Xenophon, Memor.
IV, 3, ¹3·

42. 13. solem et animum deum. In the Memorabilia the sun is
nowhere called God; and os the soul it is only said τοῦ θείου μετέχει.

42. 13. modo unum, tum autem plures deos. It is true that
Xenophon sometimes uses the plural οἱ θεοί, sometimes the singular ὁ θεός, .

only to designate the divine power in general, not this or that particular
god. An especial designation osa supreme God governing and maintain-
ing the world as opposed to the other gods, is found only in IV, 3, 13, a
passage u h1ch is considered uitliout reason by some critics as an inter-
polation, though an old one.

42, ¹4 [sunt iisdem in erratis. We say in English that a person
is in error3 but here we must translate by the adjective. So below ξ 37:
magno in errore sententia cst: De Fin. ΙΙ, 14, 47: Atque his tribus gene-
ribus honestorum notatis quartum sequitur et in eadem pulchritudine et
aptum ex illis tribus,· a similar use in Tusc. III, 18, 42: Quae sequuntur
in eadem sententia sunl ἃς]

13 4215 Antisthenes os Athens, disciple of Socrates, founder os the

find: παρ’ Α’ντισθέιει δ’ ει τῷ φῑσικῲ Myer-(u τὸ κατὰ νόμον εἶναι mannis
θεοὺς, κατὰ δὲ oron· ἕνα, His speculations in natural philosophy led him to
the idea of one God, at the same time that he allowed the traditional gods
of the popular belief to pass for creatures and subordinate servants of the
supreme God, just as other philosophers did. The judgment therefore
that follows, tollit rim ct naturam deorum, is to be regarded as unsounded.

42. 18. Speusippus, likewise os Athens, and successor of his uncle
Plato in the Academy.

42. 18. vim quandam . . . eamque animalem. An animal, i.e. a
living force, a soul of the universe. From Stob. Ecl. Ι, p. 58 taken
