10 DE NATURA DEORUM.

more perfect beingS‚ of purer etherial substance, without gross
bodies, sinless and wise from the beginning; these are the gods
(see 11, 13, 35). Considered in this respect the theology of the
Stoics may be characterized as a monotheism and a polytheism
combined. For the one being, whence everything has proceeded.
is alone God in the true sense of the word, uncreated‚ imperishable,
and eternal. The other gods are not eternal, but created and per-
ishable beings‚ that at the universal dissolution of all things will
‚return into the primaeval being whence they came. Further, in the
recognition by the Stoics of different sorts of such created gods we
may recognize on the one hand a logical deductiori from their specu-
lative physics, on the other only a concession to the popular saith.
It followed from their physical views of the constitution of the fire-
like ether, that they also had to explain the constellations, which
consisted of it, to be gods. But when they accepted gods that⁴
were only deified mortals, or gods only as originators and con-
trollers of certain human relations and moral sorce8, oi· as givers of
various gifts, they evidently only followed the popular belief; and
so in Cicero‘s account of their doctrines (ll, 23, 60) we do not find. as
in the case of the highest deity and ot‘ the constellation-5, a demon—
stration of the existence of these gods, but only the simple remark,
that such deities were accepted by wise men not without reason.
The same is the case with the gods which we may designate as
natural spirits, which bear rule in various parts of the world, the
earth, the sea, the fire, &a The Stoics accepted these too, because
they found the belief in them among the people, and because they
felt obliged, not to reject, but rather to recognize a sort of natural
revelation in the popular saith, so far as it contained nothing contra-
dictory to reason, nothing plainly false and perverted. But it can-
not be ignored, that all these deities occupied an uncertain and am—
biguous position in their system of theology; and if we had fuller
accounts than have actually come down to us of the views ot' indi-
vidual Stoics, we should doubtless find not only that they had dif-
fered among themselves on this point, but that the same thinker had
not always consistently held the same opinion. The Stoics were
reproached by their antagonists with believing that the popular gods
were such only in name, not in reality: partly because they repre-
sented them as created and perishable beings. and conceded immor-
tality only to the one highest being, whom it is true they called
