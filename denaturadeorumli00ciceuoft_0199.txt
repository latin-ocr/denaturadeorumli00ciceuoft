34.12. desertaeque disciplinae. See below c. 5, 11. Antiochus,
mentioned just below, is to be regarded as a desertor os the Academy.

34. 19. Diodotus, a Stolo, lived for several years in Cicero's house
and lest him a considerable property at his death.

34. 19. Philo os Larissa, an Academic, ssed during the Mithridatic war
in 666 from Athens to Rome, where Cicero, as he himself says Brut. 89,

306, totum se ei tradidit. 11e was the last representative os any note of
the Academic philosophy. Philone vivo patrocinium Academiae non
difuit says Cic. Acad. 11, 6, 17.

34. 19. Antlochus of Ascalon, a dis-ciple of Philo, bnt not his suc-
cessor. He abandoned the Academie scepticism and devised sor himself
an eclectic, dogmatic system composed of Platonic‚ Aristotelic and Stoic
tenets taken together. Comp. Acad. 11, 22, 69; and especially Madvig,
Presaee to Cic. De Fin., p. 61, ff.

34. 2o. Posidonius of Apamea in Syria, (lisciple os the Rhodian
Panaetius, the most distinguished of the Stoics at that time. He lived and
taught mostly at Rhodes and is hence called Rhodian, but also passed
some time at Rome. All that remains of his numerous writings in frag-
ments and citations may be found in Posidonii reliquiae doctrinae. Coll.
alque illustr. J. Bake. Lugd. B. 1810. 8.

magnificum illud eliam Romanisque hominibus gloriosum, ut Graecis de
philosophia litteris non egeant.

34. 31. multorum—scribendi studia. Comp. De Offic. 11, 1, 2. 8
No notice has come down to us of the many whom Cicero here speaks of.
We know indeed that several of his contemporaries wrote in Latin on
philosophical topics, for example P. Nigidius Figulus and M. Terentius
Varro, not to speak of the poet Lucretius ; but they were not induced to
do so by Cicero’s example any more than the Epicureans Amafinius,
Rabirius and Catius, whom he mentions disparagingly. Acad. Ι, 1, 53
Tusc. IV, 3, 6; Ad Famil. XV, 16, 13 19, 1. Perhaps however Brutus
and Plancus mentioned by Quintilian X, 1, 123 and C. Asinius Pollio were
among those whom he has in mind.

35. 2. vinceremur, not vincamur. The imperfect limits the re—
mark to Cicero’s previous writings‚ and the sense is simply that he suc-
ceeded in not falling behind his Graeciam models in adequate expression
os philosophie ideas. In another place with patriotic enthusiasm he main-
tains broadly Latinam linguam uon modo non inopem, ut vulgo putant,
sed locupletiorem etiam esse quam Graecam, De Fin. I, 3, 103 comp. ΙΙΙ,
