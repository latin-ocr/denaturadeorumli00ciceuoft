BOOK 11.-Cnm2. VI, ξς ι4-ι7. 237

clearly. It is not in spite os his real ability, that he has made such an
argument, but because his ability, however great people thought it, was even
still greater than the common opinion. 'l'he excellence os his argumenta-
tion therefore was to be opposed not to his ability itsels‚ hut to the common
opinion of his ability, somewhat thus: quamquam accerrimo esse ingenio
credatur, tamen, quae dicit, eiusmodi stmt ἃς. Ἆᾟεὼετ the argumenta-
tion really required so much keenness is another question; however that
may be, it had already been made before Chrysippus by Cleanthes as may
be seen from Sext. Emp. lx, 83.

[According to the preceding note the drift of the sentence would be
that Chrysippus in the argument that follows showed himself to be cleverer
than he was generally thought to be. But taking the language as it stands
the opposition would rather seem to be between acerrimo ingenio and ab
ipsa natura ‚· “ although he is a man of very keen mind and so quite able
to construet a perfectly sound and convincing argument, yet the argument
which he actually makes on this point is so sublime that you would think
he had ‘borrowed a leaf from the book of nature,’ and not have found it
out himself.’' The point of the remark is then not the greater or less
keenness of Chrysippus, but the soundness and beauty of the argument3
and in the mouth of a Stoie this seems more natural than a very dubious
compliment to Chrysippus]

83. 20. (a) quo illa conficiuntur. The preposifion, wanting in
almost all Mss., is as indispensable here as before homine in the preceding
sentence. Comp. Hand Tursell. 1, p. 31 f., and below ΙΙΙ, ιο, 25 where
the same argument is made in somewhat different language.

83. 26. desipientis adrogantiae. Comp. De Leg. ΙΙ, 7, 16: quid
est enim verius, quam neminem esse oportere tam stulle adrogantem, ut in
se rationem et mentem putet inesse, in caelo mundoque non putet?

83. 29. [A. du Mesnil in Fleckeisen's Jahrb. 1877, p. 760 proposes
to strike out the non ,· Miiller (Adnotat. Crit.) approves, adding: The
sentence is negligently written3 it should run either thus: An . . ‚possis
adduci, ut putes ,· tantum ergo ornatum . . . nonne desipere videare? or
thus : An . . . non possis adduci, ut pules ‚⁰ tantum ornatum . . . ut tuum
ac non deorum . . . putes, possis ἒ]

83. 30. et mustelis. The ancients kept weasels as well as cats in
their houses for the destruction of mice. Comp. Phaedr. Fab. 1, 22 ς Peri-
gon. on Aelian. V. H. XIV, 4.

83. 34. omnia supera esse mellera- This sentence leads us to

expect a line of argument similar to that in Sextus Emp. IX, 86 ff. ε 11311181γή

that the beings who live in the higher regions of the universe must be of a
higher, superhuman nature, and therefore gods. Instead of this hfiwever
