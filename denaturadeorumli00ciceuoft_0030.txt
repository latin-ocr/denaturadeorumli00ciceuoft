20 DE NATURA DEORU 31.

omnem consolationem vincit dolor. Quin etiam feci. quod prcffecto
ante me nemo, ut ipse me per litteras consolarer.¹ Affirmo tibi nullam
consolationem esse talem. T otas dies scribo, non quo proficiam ali-
quz'd3 scd tantisper impedior, non equidem satis, —vt's enim urget, —
sed νείατον tamen enitorqne ad animum reficiendum. There was no
opportunity, as public affairs were at the time, for him to engage in
thern with dignity and success, and so obtain relies from his sorrow;
and this condition of the state itself sor a man like Cicero was no
less a source of sadness, than his own domestic grief.

When we consider these circumstances we are little disposed to
pass a strict judgment on Cicero's philosophical works, but rather
to excuse many undoubted shortcomings in an old man afflicted and
borne down by sadness and care. Even a philosopher by profession
would hardly have been able in such a state of mind and in so short
a time to write satisfactorily upon all the most difficult problems of
philosophy at such length3 how much less a man, who, however
earnestly he had studied these subjects, was really only a dilettante3
and who for the larger and better part of his life had been occupied
as a statesman and an advocate with great activity and brilliant suc-
cess. His philosophical writings are in fact little else than transla-
tions or extracts from Greek predecessors²; and we should not
wonder at many misunderstandings or other traces of haste and care-
lessness, which have been occasionally noticed in the notes of this
volume, and which have given a welcome opportunity to critics fond
of emendations to show their skill. A striking case of this haste is
the hesterno die 11, 29, 73, and nudius tertius III, 7, 18, as if the
conversation had occupied three days, whereas the beginning of the
second as well as that of the third book represent it as begun and
finished on one and the same day.³ These defects must not how-
ever prevent us from a thankful recognition of Cicero's merits even
as a philosophical writer. He was the first to develop the Latin

1 This refers to the lost De Consolatione, the fragments of which are found in
Orelli IV, 2, p. 489 ff.

2 He himself once calls them ἁπόγρηφα, Ad Attio. ΧΙΙ, ep. 52: Ἀπόγραφη
sunt: minore lnborefinnl: verba tantum offero, quibus abundo.

³ Nude'us tertius would be an error too with the division into three days, as in
that case the discourse of Balbus. to which it refers. must have been made on
the day immediately preceding¹ and not two days before.
