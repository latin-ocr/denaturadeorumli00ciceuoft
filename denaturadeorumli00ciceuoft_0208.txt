182 NOTES.

ipsa nihil valeat, the clause with ut is the plain statement of the opinion.
'sake the example in Fam. XV, 15, 2: equidem fateor meam coniecturam
hanc juisse ul—communi saluti consuli vellent: was his conjecture that
he conjectured so and so? De Fin. II, 3, 6: lloc vcro optimum, ut is . . .
nesciat. De Div. 11 2, 5: ,vllagnisicum illud . . . ut . . . non egeant. Tuse.
IV, 47: ita enim (afluit, ut perturbatio sil ἂι, not a result, but the sub—
stance os the delinition, censet . . . esse. Fam. XV, 2, 8: hac opinione ut. . .
liberarit. In all these cases the ut clause does not express a result, but
merely the idea in a simple form as a conception, without regard to the
actual reality. In the text the sense isz The idea is inconceivable that
there was ever any such thing as time when there was no means of meas-
uring it. The usage is doubtless an extension of the consecutive ut, but
is sufficiently common to be noticed apart.]

39. 11. signis et luminibus. The second word is in a measure
explanatory os the first5 sor signa are here the heavenly bodies, as it
were lights os heaven, as below c. 13, 35. Lucr. 1, 1088: atque ideo
totum circumtrcmere aethera segnis. Signa is especially used os the con-
stellations os the zodiac, as in ΙΙ, 20, 5²·

39. 12. tamquam aedilis, because the aediles had the care os deco-
rating the public places on festive occasions. That illuminations were ¹
included is not especially stated, but may be reasonably inserted. “

39. 17· ut fere (licitis. Comp. 11, 53, 133 and 62, ¹54·

39. 19. An stultorum. They are immediately aster called improbi,
because improbitas springs srorn stultitia or insipientia, i.e. the want of
that proper insight and os moral consistency in action, which belongs only
to the sapiens. According to the Stoics there is no middle term between
sapientia and stultitia (comp. De Fin. IV, 19); and as wisdom is attained
only by a very few, the great mass of men are stulti or improbi.—For
cum omnes stulti sint miserrimi comp. 111, 32, 79.

39. 20. [deinde quid est adsecutus ⁸? The deinde oecurring three
lines below is at first a little confusiug. Velleius says that these things
were not created sor the sake stultorum sor two reasons: first (at pri-
mum), because there was no occasion sor the Deity to show any savor to
the wicked (improbi or stulti); second, (deinde quid cst adsecutus ?) be·
cause it has been of no avail is he did. The answer nihil is to be under-
stood after adsecutus. This answer is now justified on two grounds: first,
(cum omnes ἃς.) because the stulti are already as wretched as they can
be from their own stultitia ,· second, (deinde quod ita multa sunt Sne.)
because of the many ills os lise ἃς]

39. 23. ut ea sapientes &e The consequence os the clause ita
multa sunt incommoda is really contained iu the second os the two clauses
