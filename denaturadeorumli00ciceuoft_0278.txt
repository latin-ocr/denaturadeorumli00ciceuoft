246 NOTES.

whereas before tactus denoted the sense of touch itself. Comp. De Div.
ΙΙ, 46, 97: ex quo intelligitur plus terrarum situs quam lunae tactus (the
effect of the moon) ad nascendum valere. Comp. De Or. 11, 14, 60.

90. 28. Oceanique alatur umoribus. Comp. c. 33, 83 and 46, 118.
Diog. L. VII, 145: τρέφε-σθαι δὲ . . . τὸνμὲν ἡλιον ἐκ τῆς μεγάλης θαλάττης,
νοερὸν ‹hu-a ἁναμμα, τὴν δὲ σελήνην ἐκ ποτίμων ὑδάτων, ἀερομιγῆ τηχάνουσαν
καὶ πρόσγειον οὖσαν. Comp. Ideler on Arist. Meteor. ΙΙ, 2, 6.— [posset is
an emendation of Miiller. Schoemann reads] possit=‹li·1·0c.·' ἂν, modus
pole-nl. The protasis is contained in sim' pastu: nisi pascatur.

41 90. 32. confector· consumptorque. The second word serves to
detine the first, which of itself alone might be ambiguous. Confictrix
rerum omnium vetustas is cited from Cicero by Lactantius VII, 11, 5.

90. 34. ille corporeus, i.e. qui cst in corporibus ,· although in other
places the word rather means “corporeal,” corpore praeditus, as also in
Cicero Time. c. 4 and 8. On the other hand in De Fin. 111, 14, 45 res
corporeae are bodily endowments, as health, beauty &c.-It is hardly
necessary to remark that {gnis [oppertus here is quite the same with hic-
uoster calor above ξ 30, the heat which gives life and growth to all earthly
creatures. This comcs from the ardor caelatis, the ether of the highest
regionS, where it is pure and unmixed with grosser matter. Cicero uses

⁰ ardor for the Greek αἰθὴρ (from αῑ()ω); and Balbus below c. 36, 91 thinks
it necessary to make a sort of excuse for employing it as being less current
in Latin.

91. 5. et quidem, here equivalent to el profecto,- an addition with
emphasis.

42 91. 8. Aristoteli videtur. No such remark is to be found in the
extant writings of Aristotlc3 but the Ps. Plutarch (Plac. Phil. V, 20) says:
ἐστι πραγματεία Ἀριστοτέλους, ἑν ὴ τέσσαρα >ia-1] ζώων φησί, χερσαῖα, ἔνυδρα,
πτηνά, οὐράνια. Besides comp. note I, 13, 333 and Bernays, p. 102.

91. 13. in iis sensum inesse &c It would have been more correct,
and more adapted to the purpose of the argument, had Cicero written: in
iis sensum acerrimum inesse cl intellegentiam celerrimam.

16 91. 15. Etenim licet videre. Etenim introduces not a reason for
the proposition immediately preceding, which, as following from undis-
puted promises, needed no further reason, but rather a reason in addition
to those already brought sorward; it is therefore a new link in the chain
of reasoning, and would have been introduced quite as well at least by
porro or praetcrea. Cicero often uses etenim and enim in this way.
Comp. Madvig De Fin. Ι, 1, 3. The warrant sor this usage is to be found
in the real meaning of enim, which originally was not causative but only
asseverative.
