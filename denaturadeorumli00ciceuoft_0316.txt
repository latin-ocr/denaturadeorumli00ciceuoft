stantive itself, oculis, in its place may be compared with similar examples
such as are given in c. 9, 25 note.

[This passage is quoted by Isidorus, Etymolog. XI, 39 ed. Migne, and
runs thus: .llunitae sunt autem (palpebrae) vallo capillorum, ut et aper·
tis oculis, si quid inciderit, repellatur, et somno conniventibus, tanquam
involuti quiescant latentes. In our text we have changed † ut qui of Miil·
ler and the Mss. to ut ii,—taking the sense of the passage to be this:
1. 8, ct somno coniventibus (sc. palpebris), cum oculis ad cernendum mm
egeremus, ut ii (sc. oculi) tamquam involuti quiescerent]

125. 17. ne quid intrare possit, si pateret. The elliptical expres-
sion might be supplemented by quozlfieret or fieri posset, si pateret. So

125. 24. his naturis = rebus huius naturae.

125. 25. testudine . . . aut cornu. In stringed instruments the
strings are stretched sometimes over a hollow body, testudo, as in the case *
of the cithara (guitur), sometimes between two hollow arms, as in the
case os the lyra. These were called cornua. See ξ 149.

125. 33. multa cernunt: subtutuS‚ sc. quam bestiae. The compara-
tive is used in all languages in such a way that for the other side of the
comparison one must supply not a positive, but a negative. See Nitzsch ou
Plato's Ion, p. 66. Here we must supplement subtilius quam bestiae, quae
nilcil subtiliter cernunt. ,

126. 1. tum venustatem. The tum is awkward, because there is no
corresponding tum afterwards and it cannot be taken as correlative to
the preceding primum, unless with Hand Tursell. 1, p. 766 we strike out
the words colorum etiam et figurarum as a spurious addition. Perhaps
some old reader wrote on the margin tum for the following atque, and
copyists afterwards inserted it in the text in the wrong place. —‘The word
decentia is of Cicero‘s coinage, as the ut ita dicam indicates, in order to
express the idea of εὐπρέπεια better than could be done by venustas and
ordo. [Schoemann reads etfigwrarum tum venustatem, the common read-
ing. Miillei· thinks something has been lost, perhaps cum . . . corre-
sponding to tuna]

126. 4. timidumque cognoscunt. One or 'the other cog-noscunt
might have been omitted or something else, like dignoscunt, been used in
its place, but the haste os the writer is evident too in this repetition.

126. 7. intervalla, distinctio. The former denotes the differenees
os tone in respect to piteh, in English “intervals‚” διαστήματα ὀξίιτητός τε
περὶ καὶ βαρίντητος (Schneider Ecl. Phys„ p. 310); the latter probably
