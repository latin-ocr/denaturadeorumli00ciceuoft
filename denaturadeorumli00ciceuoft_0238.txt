208 NOTES.

51. 2ο. Leucippi. “plenum et inane dixit esse, unde omnia gig-ne·
rentur.’' Cic. Acad. ΙΙ, 37, 118. The plenum, παμπληθές, was an intinity
of infinitely small invisible and indivisible particles, στερεά, ἀδιαίρετα, direc-
pa τὸ πλῆθος καὶ ἀόρατα διὰ σμικρότητα τὼν ὁ) κων. Arist. De Gen. et Corr.
I, 8. —- Leucippus was however but very little older than Democritus.

51. 29. Quid enim mer-eas? ‘¹ what could induce you <what would
you take) to give up being an Epicurean ?” Comp. De fin. 11, 22, 74 ε
Quid enim mereri velis . . . quid merearis igitur, ut dicas te onmia volup-
tatis causa sucturum? Verr. IV, 60, 135: quid arbitramini Rhegluos
merere velle ut ab iis marmorea illa Venus auferatur ?

52. 2. nulla moderante natura. This contradicts what Velleius
said above, c. ’“ But in a certain degree both are true. The atoms
in moving perpenuica *anward plainly obey a law of nature; but
they vary from this direction wune. specilic law, and it is only by virtue
of this variation that the origin of the world is possible. See note to c.
25, 69.

52. 8. ut tu paulo aute; above c. 8, 20.

52. ιι. in dumeta conr-ipius. The simile is taken from game hard
pursued and flying into the thick wood where the hunter cannot easily fol-
low; so the Epicureans recur to propositions that are unintelligible and
hence hard to controvert. This is shown in the following chapter by two
examples, which are foreign to the main subject; that is taken up again
in c. 26, 73-

52. 19. nihil fore in nostra potestate. Inasmuch as the soul also
consists of atoms, is the atoms had no power os varying from the course
prescribed by the law of nature, all the activities of the mind must follow
the law os nature, and free will would be excluded. For this reason Epi-
curus conceded to the atoms a certain power os voluntary motion, which
enabled him, he thought, to explain by the concurrence of the atoms thus
varying from the perpendicular line both the origin of the universe and
the sreedom os the human will. Comp. Cic. De Fato, c. 10, 223 and
especially Lucret. ΙΙ, 2¹7 ff. and 25¹ ff.

52. 21. quod Democritum fugerat, because Democritus had
assumed not a perpendicular motion with a voluntary deviation, but a
whirling motion inherent in the nature of the atoms and taking place of
necessity. Diog. L. IX, 45 t πάντα τε κατ’ ἀνάγκην γενέσθαι τῆς δίνης αἰτίας
οὺσης τῆς γενέσεως πάντων, ἢν ἀνάγκην λέγει, ” 3 De Fin. I, 6, 18.

52. 25. aut etiam aut non, ‘·' either Yes or N0.‘' Compare De Fato,
c. ιο, 21 ; and Acad. 11. 30, 97 where the same thing is said of Epicurus ;
and sor etiam sor affirmation see Heindorf's note to Hor. Sat. 11, 3, 97.
