302 NOTES.

data est: quam quod amor civium, non vis expresserat, nullam habuit in-
vidiam. The same atti-aetion with the demonstrative occurs Sallust Catil.
c. 11, 2: huic quia bonae artes desunt, dolis atque fallaciis contendit.—
On intellegi noluit comp. 1, 26, 74.

147. 2. omnem vim esse igneam. More distinctly expressed it
could have read τ omnem vim vitalem csse igneam ,· sor this was the opinion
os the Stoics. See 11, 9, 23. 24.

36 147. 7. id . . . de calido, i.e. id quod de calido dicitis, commune huic
est cum umore et spiritu ,· or: pariter de umore ct spiritu dici potest.

147. 9. animal intrinsecus, the same as ex sese animal which occurs
below, “ having lise from itself, an independent existence.”

147. 10. animam, unde . . . constet animus. It was an ancient and
wide-spread opinion that the soul was aerial and maintained by breathing.
Comp. Tusc- 1, 1, 19: Animum autem alii animam, ut sere nostri decla-
rant nomine. Nam et agere animam et efflare dicimus . . . ,· ipse autem
animus ab anima dictus est. Further details may be found in Lobeck'
Agl„ p. 755 ff.

147. 19. ad eundem etiam interitum venire. In the soregoing
member Cicero used the subjunctive after neccsse cst: it is easy to see why
he now changes to the infinitive. This might be taken to depend on the
foregoing eadem dici possunt, but not so well3 and the change of con-
struction occurs in other passages. Comp. Acad. ΙΙ, 12, 39: ante videri
aliquid quam agamus necesse est, eique quod visum sit, assentiatur, sor
assentiri ,· De Fin. V, 9, 25: neccsse est finem omnium hunc esse, ut na-
tura expleatur . . ., sed extrema illa ct summa inter animalium genera
distincta et dispertita sint, for csse.

37 147. 23. ali autem solem ἃς. See 11, 33, 83 and 46, 118.

147. 24. Eamque causam. Cleanthes adfert. This is not men-
tioned elsewhere as the opinion of Cleanthes, but agrees very well with that
which Diog. L. VII, 145 ascribes to the Stoics in general, that the sun
draws its nourishment from the great sea. For the great sea separates our
οἰκουμένη from the opposite southern one (see note to ΙῘ. 66, 164), and lies
itself in the hot zone between the two tropics, one of which, the Tropic of
Cancer, Cicero here calls the solstitialis orbis, the other, the Tropic of
Capricorn, hr1mml1‘s.—1t has been noticed that the word< eur se . . . pro·
grediatur form a hexameter. Comp. note on ΙΙ, 60, 151.

147. 26. Hoc totum quale sit, mox. Balbus had put forth this
view of the nourishrnent ot' the heavenlv bodies by waterv vapours in the
portion os his discourse devoted to the di<cuzzi0n os the divine providence,
II, 45, 118. Cotta proposes to postpone his answer until he comes to
consider the same subject. But this part of his argument has been lost.
