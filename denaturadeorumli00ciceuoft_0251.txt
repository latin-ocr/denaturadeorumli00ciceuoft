63. 4. Haec oratio . . . spoliat, i.e. what you say takes away from 37
the gods motion Sec. In the same way De Leg. 1, 3, 10: Legationem
aliquam nimirum ista oratio postulat ,· what you say indicates a wish sor
a legatio. Comp. ΙΙ, 1, 3 and 10, init.

Seneca Quaest, Nat. V, 6 says of the animals mentioned here: ignis, qui
omnia consumit, quaedam etiam creat, et quod videri potest non simile
veri, tamen verum est, animalia igne generari. And Pliny H. N. XI, 36:
ln Cypri aerariis fornacibus ex medio igni maioris muscae magnitudinis
volat pennatum quadrupes ,· appellatur pyralis, a quibusdam pyrausta.
Quamdiu est in igni vivit ,· cum evasit longiore paulo volatu, emoritur.
In other connections pyraustae denote what we eall millers.

63. 25. Sic enim dicebas, τῖε. above c. 19, 49: but there Velleius 105
says not speciem dei, but vim et naturam deorum, which is quite a
different thing. The species are taken cognizance of by the mind through
the imagines which affeet it, although afterward further reasons are found ς
but the nature of the gods cannot, like their form, be known from imagi—
nes, but only be deduced by the reason, mente or cogitatione cerni: they
are according to Epicurus only λόγῳ θεωρητοὶ

63. 26. neque eandem ad numerum permanere· This could only
mean that the divine forms do not remain the same but are variable in
respect to number ; that they therefore appear now in greater now in les-
ser number. But according to Epicurus there can be no question of nurn-
ber in regard to the gods. Cicero perhaps wrote neque eam ad numerum
permanare, so that ad numerum would be taken in the sense given in the
note to ξ 49, i.e. sic ut numerari possit, and permanare in that osflowing,
the transitio of the images. So far as concerns the language there would
be no objection to this ; and in fact one Ms. has permanare, which would
of course however have very little weight if the sense were not in its favor.
Lachmann also writes eam for eandem in note on Lucret., p. 24, but retains
permanere.
