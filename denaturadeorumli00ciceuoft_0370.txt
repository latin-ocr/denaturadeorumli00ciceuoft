330 DE NATURA DEORUM.

Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 363. —That zjgnem in the succeeding clause is not to be under-
stood os the common earthly as opposed to the etherial tire, as the most
recent translator has it, would be evident, not only from the note to the
passage and what is said in the summary os the second book, p. 73, but
from the position alone of ignem in the phrase, which would be hard to
explain is the common tire were really intended.

I, 19, 49. A. Brieger (Beitr. zur Kritik einig. phil. Schr. des Cicero,
Posen, 1873) has rightly remarked thatin the words eam csse vim et na-
turam deorum, ul non sensu scd mente cernatur the phrase mente cerni,
opposed to sensu cerni, can mean nothing but the ψυχικὴ αἱσθησις, i.e.
the simple perception by the faculty which Lucretius calls the mens
animi, and in which the feeling, perceiving and thinking capacity of the
soul dwells. The same statement is therefore made here as in Lucret. V,
149, tenuis enim natura deum longeque remola sensibus a nostris animi
vix mente videtur. But we must not neglect the differeuce of vis et na-
tura deorum and tenuis natura deum. The latter, on account os the
epithet tenur's, can only be understood os the divine quasi corpus which
the mind perceives, because in virtue of its possessing the same tenuitas it
is in immediate contaet with and direetly affected by it ; the vis e! natura
‹kun-um is something inore than this quasi corporeality, and denotes the
whole outer and inner constitution upon which the vitae actio and the
menlis agilalio (ξ 45 ss.), virtue, wisdorn‚ happiness and immortality of
the gods depend. Is in the passage under discussion we are to under·
stand simply the corporeality os the gods, of which we are eognizant by
mere perception, Cicero could not have written cernatur, which would
only admit vis et namra t'or its subject, but cernantur, sc. di, which Ι
(Prof. Sch.) have therefore restored. The perceptible tenuitas of the gods,
although not the same as their vis et natura, still is a part of it, is one side
os their being, and may therefore as depending upon this be designated by
ul: it lies in the nature of the gods that their corporeality as well should
be perceivahle only by the mens, and not by the senses. In the Greek
original which Cicero used there was probably an infinitive depending on
ὥστε, perhaps γιγνώσκεσθαι, which could be rendered in Latin by the singu-
lar as well as by the plural os the finite verb. Thus Cotta in his reply
(ξ ¹05) takes the proposition as applicable only to the corporeality and
not to the collective being os the gods, and speaks of the speciem dei be-
cause this alone in the gods is what we immediately perceive, quod mente
cernitur. XVhen Cicero makes him say percipi cogitatione instead of the
mente cerni os Velleius. we may regard it as the result os the same haste
apparent in other passages in this treatise, which caused him to overlook
thc diffcrence between the two expressions.
