236 NOTES.

82. 20. [Primam posuit eam ἃς. One is almost tempted to refer eam
and alteram to notiones, considering the expressions eam, quae orta esset,
and alteram, quam ceperimus,· but farther on we tind tertiam, quae terre-
ret, and Quartam causam esse δια, which show that the antecedent is
causis. The passage is carelessly written]

82. 28. praeter· naturam . . . portentis; a hyphen, as above c. 2, 5.

82. 30. nuper bello Octaviano. A.u.c. 667. The consul Cu. Octa·
vius, a partisan of Sulla, was besieged and slain by his colleague L. Cor·
nelius Cinna and Marius who had just returned from Africa, while Sulla
was fighting against Mithridates. Bellum Octavianum also in De Div. 1,
2, 43 Philipp. XIV, 8, 23; Florus ΙΙΙ, 21, 9. The adverb nuper might
seem to indicate that we must imagine the present conversation to have
taken place but a short time after that war. But the meaning of nuper is
very relative, and it is hence used of somewhat remote periods of time, as
in De Div.1, 39, 85: ante philosophiam patefactam quae nuper inventa
est: and c. 50, 126 we even find ε quae nuper, id est paucis ante saeculis,
reperta sunt; where the period of modern culture is opposed to the early
dark and uncultivated ages.

82. 32. Tuditano (C. Sempronio) et (ΛΓ.) Aquilio coss. A.U.C. 625.
On the death of Scipio Africanus see III, 32, 80 and note. The double sun
in that year is also referred to in De Repub. Ι, 10, 15.

83. 4. non esse ea fortuita for eas fortuitas. Comp. above e. 3, 7;
and below 7, 18 extr.; also 34, 87; and 35, 88; De Leg. 11, 11, 28: Bene
vero quod mens, pictas, virtus, fides consecralur . . . ut, illa qui habeant
. . .‚ deos ipsos in animis suis collocatos putent. The use of the neuter here
is not strange because the objeets to which the pronoun refers have only a
grammafical, not a natural, gender.

83. 4. [Ut‚ si quis ἃς. L't here means “as for example ''; and cor—
responds to mullo magis . . . statuat neccsse est below. The apodosis of Si
quis . . . venerit is non possit ἃς]

83. 10. nihil . . . vetustas mentita sit, i.e. the endless lapse of time
has never deceived men's expectations ; the phenomena have always hap·
pened just as they ought and were expected to do according to the laws
observed by men. Comp. c. 21, 56. Τίς )έ·ιόιτ’ ἂν distri-clem †01‹i‹5c; is the
question asked in a similar connection in the treatise De Mundo, c. 5,
falsely ascribed to Aristotle, but the work of some later Peripatetic.

83. 12. Chrysippus quidem. See note Ι, 15, 39.—quamquam
est acerrimo ingemo, tamen . . . If Cicero meant to say that, elever
as Chrysippus may have been, the following argumentation was cleverer
than one would have expected of him, he has not expressed himself very
