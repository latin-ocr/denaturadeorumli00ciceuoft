2 70 NOTES.

’ἐξ 111. 31. superaque. Priscian XIV, 2, 11, p. 980 Putsch.: Quaedam
praepositiones ctiam syncopam passae sunt, ut supra pro supera, et infra
pro infera, cl extra pro extera. Λάηι antiqui trisyllaba ea proferebant,
ut Cicero in Arato .· ‘ Torvu' draco,’ etc.

107 112. 1. [cum totius est. Schoernann has quum totius sit with the
following note] The Mss. have est, which no doubt should be changed.
'she following tum has also fallen out in the Mss. Comp. Schoemann
opusc. Ac. 111, p. 335.

112. 3. non una modo. mbdb is here used, according to the older
Iambic measure ; later it was used as a Pyrrhic, ηιῡιίὂ. Comp. Lachmann
on Lucret. ΙΙ, 1135.

108 112. 14. ortus ubi atque obitus δια, where the East and West join,
i.e. under the North pole, where the meridian, drawn through our zenith
and prolonged beyond the pole, touches the horizon and divides the East
and West sides of the heavens. Comp. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 336. For subi-
toque recondit of the Mss. the true reading is probably, as Grotius thought,
subito aequore condit. — Subito, part. perf. pass. from subire.

112. 20. Engonasin; ἐν γόνασιν, a kneehng, armed man very near
the head os the dragon, hence id capul attingens. The kneeling man,
Lat. ingeniculas, also nixus (gm'xus according to Fleckeisen in the N.
Rh. Mus. 1852, p. 230), was explained by some to be Hercules, by some
Theseus, by others in different ways. See Voss on Aratus v. 63.-The
Corona, mentioned directly after, was explained to be the garland os
Ariadne carried to heaven by Dionysus. Atat. v. 71.

1⁰9 112. 22. Anguitenens, Ὀφιοῐχγος, the serpent-holder, was, according
to the so-called καταστερισμοί os Eratosthenes, Aesculapiuswhom Juppiter
struck by lightning and then transferred to heaven; others explained it
however differently. See Hygiu. P. Astr. ΙΙ, 14.—eius in v. 3 is to be
read as a monosyllable like cuius below c. 44, 112. —- Nepai, v. 6, “ of the
Scorpion.’'

110 113. 8. Spicum, neuter, as in Varro ap. Non„ p. 225 Mero: Neque in
bona segete nullum esl spicum nequam, neque in mala non aliquod bonum.
Comp. Cic. De Senec. c. 15, 51: fundit fimgem spici.—pedibus‚ fallen
out in the Mss„ must be restored aster Atat. v. 96.

43 113· 13. pedibusque tenetur, i.e. calmum—The tremula flamma
in the following verse denotes the scintillation οἷ the stars.
113. 18. obductus z obiectus or obversus.
113. 19. truculenta tuetur. The neuter os the adjective pei-forms
the office os an adverb, like insueta rudens Virg. Aen. VIII, 248; crebra
