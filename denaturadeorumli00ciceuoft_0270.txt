238 NOTES.

there follows something which has no necessary connection with what pre-
cedes, namely that the reason which dwells in man sorccs us to acknowledge
also a reasonable principle in the universe from which the human reason
is derived. One would think that Cicero had quoted from his original
authority rather carelessly.

84. 2. quibusdam regionibus atque urbibus. See below c. 16, 42.

84. 5. Et tamen, i.e. in spite of all its imperfectiori the human reason
is of such sort that we can only explain it as an outflow from a higher
divine reason. Comp. c. 31, 79. aliam quam would perhaps be a better
reading than aliquane ,· for the circumstances are different in passages
where aliquis seems to be equivalent to alius quis ,· see Haase's note to
Reisig, p. 338.

84. 8. apud Xenophontem. Memor. Ι, 4, 8: voiv δὲ μόνον ἆρα
οὐδαμοῦ ὂντα σὲ εὐτυχῶς πως δοκεῖς συναρπάσαι; comp. below Ill, 11, 273
Tusc. V, 13, 38: humanus autem animus, decerptus cx mente divina.
cum alio nullo nisi cum ipso deo, si hoc sas est dictu, comparari polest.

84. 10. terrenam . . . viscerum soliditatem = viscera solida et ter-
rena. Viscera includes not only the intestines but everything except skin,
bones and blood. Comp. below e. 63 extr.; Tusc. ΙΙ, 14, 34: Spartae
pueri ad aram sic verberibus accipiuntur, ut multus e visceribus sang-uis
excat: Lactant. De Opis. Dei, e. 7: deus ossa visceribus operuit. Hence
visceratio, κρεανομὶα. —Ochsner, Ecl. Cic.‚ p. 22 has correctly remarked
that animam illam would be more correct than the animum illum os the
Mss.

84. 24. tot rebus ipsis se inmutantibus, “by the transformation
os so many things within themselves ’'; i.e. their being subject to a trans·
formation which takes place in themselves by a process having its moving
spring within themselves. Evidently the changes in plants are meant,
where the plant is developed from the seed, the fruit from the flower; and
these changes stand in so close connection with the nearness or remoteness
os the sun, that one can infer its position from them. Comp. Plin. H. N.
XVIII, 27. The ancients however speak also os many other changes that
go on in plants and beasts coinciding exactly with specified seasons of the
year; examples may be found in Cic. De Div. Ι, 9, 16; 11, 14, 33; Theo-
phrast. Hist. Plant. 1, 16; Gellius N. A. IX, 7, 1 and others. The abla-
tives solstitiis brumisque are not to be tal-:en with cognosci, but serve as a
more precise (lefinition to accessus discessusque.—Solstitium‚ although
properly it denotes the winter as well as the summer solstice‚ is regularly
used to mean the latter and opposed to bruma or hiems. Iuven. IV, 92:
sic multas hiemes atque octogesima vidit solstitia. Comp. Gesn. on Varro

R. R. 1, 46.
