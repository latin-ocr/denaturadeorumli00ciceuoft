81. 13. cum auspicia posuerunt, i.e. as proconsuls or propraetors,
when their auspicia or the right rei publicae causa auspicandi had already
passed over to their successors in the consulship or praetorship. Comp.
De Div. 11, 36, 76.

81. 14. imperatores, the two P. Decii Mures, father and son, the
former in the Latin, Α.υ.(;. 415, the latter in the Gallie war, 457. See

Livy VIII, 8 and X, 28.

4 81. 19. P. (Cornelio) Scipione, G. (Marcio) Figulo coss„ A.U.c. 592.

81. 20. Τί. (Sempronius) Gracchus, the father of the two celebrated

tribunes — He was consul sor the first time in A.U.C. 576 with C. Claudius
Pulcher, the second time in 590 with M. Iuventius Thalna.

81. 21. crearet. This expression is quite frequently used of the magis-

81. 21. primus rogator, i.e. rogator primae centuriae or praeroga· ,

in Cic. De Div. 11, 35, 75 where the same story is told, or nomina referre,-
here ut eos, i.e. eorum nomina rettulit. On the other hand rogator comi·
tiorum was the person who presided over the assembly, because his duty
was to ask the people sor whom they would vote, or in case of proposed

mentioned in the text.

81. 24. quos ad soleret; a not uncommon anastrophe of the prepo-
sition with relative pronounS, as quem per, quem contra, quos adversus and

De Div. 1, 17, 33 ; Ep. ad Quin. Frat. 11, 2. —libros sc. augurales,
which probably contained a collection of the old rules and formulas with
explanations of various learned members. They are called commentarii in
De Div. ΙΙ, 18, 42.

81. 32. vitio sibi tabernaculum captum. To take the auspices
sor a proposed electoral meeting the presiding magistrate went soon aster
midnight to an appropriate open place outside os the city where a tent was
erected for the purpose: tabernaculum capere. But on his way thither, as
