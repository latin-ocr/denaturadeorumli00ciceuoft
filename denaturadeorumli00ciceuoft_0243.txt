3, 44: strabo dicitur qui est detortis oculis, paetus autem, qui cst oculis leni-
ter declinatis, cuique lzuc el illuc celeriter volz¹untur.—By the following
quae sunt in nobis the desects (vilia) indicated by the preceding words are
intended. Comp. 11, 8, 21.

56. 3. florere . . . Academiam. [That is the gods would find in
each other tantam simililmlincm, ul in iis nulla inesset certa iudicandi
nota, as Cicero puts it in ξ 5 of this book; they would perforce be New
Academicians] The joke os course must not be taken too seriously ς sor
although the gods might not be able to distinguish between themselves,
they might distinguish other objects.

56. 8. sio . . . ut dleis; above c. 18, 46. 81

56. 17. crocodilum &c. The same beasts were not accounted holy 82
in all parts of Egypt ; those which were worshipped in one part might be
killed with impunity in another, as Herodotus ΙΙ, 69 expressly says in regard
to the crocodiles; and according to Plutarch De Is. et Osir. c. 72 there
was an idea that this difference had been designedly arranged by the old
rulers to aid in dividing the people for the purpose of governing them more
easily. Ibises and cats were equally sacred throughout the whole land, and
a few other animals besides, which are enumerated in Strabo XVII, p. 812.

56. 20. illam vestram Sospitam, i.e. Juno with the epithet Sospita,
whose worship, originally peculiar to Lanuvium (hence vestram), had be-
come Roman since the year 4163 see Livy VIII, 14, 2. She is repre-
sented with a goatskin, pointed shoes, spear and shield by a statue in the
vatican (Miiller Archaeol.§ 353, 3) and on coins, best on those of the
gens Procilia in Patin‚ Famil. Rom„ p. 234. The form of construction,
instead ot' quam tibi illa vestra Sospita videtur, is a common attraction in
such comparisons. Similar instances in c. 31, 86 and ΙΙ, 11, 29. Further
examples in VVunder’s note to Cic. pro Plane„ p. 103 3 and Madvig’s note to
Cic. De Fin., pp. 150 and 294· For quam tibi see the remark at the end

of the Summary, p. 32.

Max. VIII, 11, ext. 3 (ed. Halm) says of his Vulcan : stat dissimulatae
claudicationis sub veste leviter vestigium repraesentans, ut non exprobrans
tamquam vitium, ita tamen certam propriamque dei notam decore signi-
cans.
fi 56. 33. Age et . . ducimus. Age is used in a transition to some· 84
thing new, often with porro (Verr. ΙΙ, 5, 22), nunc (Pro Rosc. Amer. 27,
108) and similar words. Comp. below ΙΙ, 47, 1203 III, 17, 433 Hand
