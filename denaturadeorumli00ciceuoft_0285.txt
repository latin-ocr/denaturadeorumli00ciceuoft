BOOK II.—C11A1¹. XXII, XXIII, ἕξ 56-61. 253

96. 23. [nec cessantium &c., “neither leading a lise of complete ἐξ
inactivity‚ as the Epicurean gods are represented to do, nor yet persorining
their functions with a labor that is excessive or irksome.‘¹ Balbus alludes
to the remarks of Velleius in 1, 20, 52.]

96. 29. monogrammos ‹leos- GodS, who have only the outlines of
a form, liniamentis dumtaxat extremis, as is said above I, 44, 123. In the
same way Lucilius called a pale and emaciated man, who was a mere
shadow, vix vivum hominem ac monogrammum. Nonius, p. 37 Merc.
Comp. above 1, 18, 493 27, 75 ; 35, 98.

96. 34. [multae . . . naturae deorum. For the expression comp.
in the preceding chapter natura mundi, ceterae naturae: De Fin. 4, 7,
16: omnis natura vult esse conservatrix sui. Below 2 3, 62 he says simply
Utilitatum igitur magnitudine constituti sunt ei di.]

96. 35. non sine eausa. These words express a concession or recog· 60
nition. The Stoic does not reject the view in question, though he does not
undertake to establish it by reasoning, because that is impossible for him
to do, The universality of the view alone gives it a claim to recognition.
Although he only allows it to hold good at first of individuals, and those
the wisest, yet its universal acceptance proves to him that there must have
been an anticipation of it in the minds os men.

97. 3. quod erat a deo natum. Comp. below § 62: qui utilitates
quasque gzgrnebanoe and De OffiC. ΙΙ, 5, 16: nulla tam detestabilis pestis
est, quae non homini ab homine nascatur.

97. 4. nomine ipsius dei: so it is only by metonymy, the gists being
called after the givers, not themselves deified as many erroneously thought.
See Ι, 14, 38 and 111, 16, 41. Comp. Plutarch De Is. et Osir. c. 70: ὥσπερ
ἡμεῖς τὸν ὠνούμενον βιβλία nhil-mmm ὠνεῖσθαί φαμεν Πλάτωνα, καὶ Μέ-
νανδρον ὑποκρίνεσθαι τὸν τὰ Μενάνδρου ποιήματα ὑποτιθέμενον, οὓτως ἐκεῖνοι
τοῖς τῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασι τὰ τῶν θεῶν δῶρα καὶ ποιήματα καλεῖν ου’-κ ἐφείδοντο,
Also Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙ, p. 56.—The following verse is from Terent.
Eun. IV, 5, 6.

97. 7. res ipsa. In default of a more definite expression Cicero makes 61
use of the vague and general term res, a certain something wherein ‘a
greater power is revealed, and in which a man, although he feels it within
himself, recognizes a gift or inspiration from higher powers. Comp. c. 31,
79. In most Mss. vis is found after ut ea ipsa ,· evidently an error, as the
connection shows. Had Cicero thought it necessary to add a noun, he would
have used res: as immediately after, {fisa res deorum nomen obtinuit.

97. 9. a M. Aemilio Scauro; about Aue. 645, when he was censor.
Fides and Alens had temples in Rome before this, as Cicero immediately
says of the former. A. Atilius Calatinus was consul 496 and 500, dictator
