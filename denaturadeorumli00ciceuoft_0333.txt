BOOK III.—CHAP.VI,V11, ξς, 12-16. 295

Cotta’s answer is lost ; the portion that remains goes to prove that divina-
tion, even isit were any thing more than a tigment of the brain, would still
be of no use to men, because what was destined to happen would happen
at any rate and could not be avoided by knowing it beforehand. This
argument is also found De niv. 11, 8, 20.

141. 1. id esse fatum. Comp. note on Ι, 20, 55. Chrysippus’s defi-

, nition in Eusebius Pr. Ev. VI, 7, 13 runs thus: τὸ ἀπαράβατον καὶ ἐξ αἰῶνος

καθῆκον τῶν αἰτιῶν, boa οὑτωσὶ κατηναγκάσθε γενέσθαι, καὶ ὃσα dilus( ἔχειν
κεκώλυται.

141. 4. fissum iecoris: probably a fissure or cut separating the dif-
ferent lobes of the liver, called limes in Seneca OEd. 365. The fissure
denoted good or evil fortune according to the circumstances; there was a
fissum vitale, afissum familiare, and other similar sorts. See De Div. ΙΙ,
6, 12. 133 Brisson. De Form. Ι, 31; Miiller Etrusk. 11, 182.

141. 4. sortis, such as were used in the temple of Fortuna at Prae-
neste for divination; they were counters, which when mixed like a pack
of cards were thrown into a vase, and one or more were drawn out.
Hense the expressions sortes aequare, sortem ducere or trahere. Comp.
De Div. I, 18, 34; ΙΙ, 33, 70; 41, 96; Suet. Tiber. 14. The sortes were
not all of the same kind, and those expressions do not have the same mean-
ing with all.

141. 10. Deciorum devotionibus. See ΙΙ, 3, 10.

141. 11. [eorum refers to deos in the preceding sentence; iniquitas
is unfairness, injustice]

141. 18. Faunus omnino quid sit nescio; zle. as a philosopher, and ⁴

especially of the Academy‚ he does not know it ; as pontifex of course he
knows what the Faunus is, at least he knows what invocations and prayers
are to be directed to him, what manifestations of power are to be expected
from him, what sanctuaries and fensts are sacred to him; on all this con-
sult the citations of Merkel on Ovid. Fast. Prolegg„ p. CCII. For nam as
a particle of transition see note on c. 24, 61.

141. 22. formatas for infirmatas, more common in this sense, which
was also used above II, 5, 13.—The following repetition of the reasons
adduced by Cleanthes changes the order there followed, putting the third
before the second ; evidently because Cotta after answering the argument
from divination wishes now to trent only the third, that drawn from the
wonderful and awe-inspiring phenomena of nature, leaving the second and
fourth for a later part of the discourse when he means to speak of the
divine providence, the same arguments being applicable to both. He thus
avoids repeating the same thing as Balbus did. That portion of Cotta's
discourse is however lost.
