θρεπτική only, beasts with a ψυχὴ αἰσθητικὴ besides, men with a λογική
also. Comp. Arist. De. An. ΙΙ, 3; Macrob. In Somn. Scip. 1, 14, 7; and
19, 23.

13 88. 34. Quartus autem gradus. It is evident that while the first
three grades are known by experience, the fourth is only assumed to com-
plete the series, which otherwise would not include the most perfect being5‚
as is seen from ξ 35.

88. 35. natura boni sapientesque. Comp. Senec. Epist. 95: di im-
mortales nullam didicere virtutem, cum omni editi, et pars naturae eorum
est esse bonos. Φύσει καθαροὶ καὶ ἀκήρατοι in Epict. IV, 11, 3. Deorum
virtus natura excellit, hominum aulem industria, Cic. Top. c. 20, 76.

89. 1. ratio recta constansq1m3 reason that always hits the mark,
true to itself, never falling into contradiction with itsels: λόγος ὀρθὸς καὶ
όιιιοὶογοίμειός καὶ βέβαιος καὶ ἀμετάπτωτος (Plut. De Virt. Mor. c. 3); to
think and act in conformity with this is wisdorn and virtue.

The recta ratio is snpra hominem putanda only in so sar as regards
an inborn reason, not one that is gradually ‹lcveloped and brought to per-
fection. For although man very seldom really reaches it, it is not to be
thought utterly impossible; homo enim sapiens ficri polest he says below
§ 36. But comp. De Offic. ΙΙΙ, 4, 163 De Amic. c. 5, 18.

35 89. 4. in ulla rerum institutione, in the case of any organized sys-
tem οἱ things 3 os any things which are arranged by nature or by man.

89. 9. in omni natura, i.e. in universa natura or rerum omnium
natura, hence in mundo. On rerum omnium natura, which is here at
least as fitting as r. omnis n. comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 362. [ac
connects sic and multo tnagis,- “in the same manner and in much higher
degree.’‘]

36 89. 25. deterior· potius. polius is by no means superfluous, merely
strengthening deterior. On the contrary it alone really serves sor the com-
parison os the two members; the assertion is that the predicate deterior
would be applicable to the condition of the mundus rather than to that of
man. The comparison to which the comparative deterior points is not
sully developed in the sentence, because it is easily understood without
that; we may supplement thus, deterior de duabus.

37 89. 31. undique aptum: “on all sides, i.e. in all respects suitably
arranged.’‘ —omnibus suis numeris et partibus. The second expres-
sion might have been omitted ; sor numeri osten denotes all the essential
parts of a thing, conformably to the Greek usage ; as in Diog. L. VII, 100:
τὸ τέλειον ἀγαθὸν παρὰ τὸ πάντας ἀπέχειν τοὺς ἐπιζητουμένους ἀριθμοὺς ὑπὸ
τῆς φὺσεως.
