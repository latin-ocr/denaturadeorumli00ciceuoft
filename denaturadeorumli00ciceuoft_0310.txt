is a fact however that they relieve each other in leading the tram.—
[Schoemann reads una succedit ex iis and continues this notez] ln the
Mss. una has fallen out because of the soregoing um. It is difficult to
believe that Cicero himself lest out the subject ot‘ the sentence.

119. 25. [lam introduces something new; vcro emphasizes it as more
important than the preceding3 illa also calls attention to the points which
immediately follow defining it. b'o in ς’ 127 init.: lam illa cernimus, ut διο.
ln § 132 lam introduces the last os a series, which is much less common.
Sections 132 and 141 are interesting sor the use of the particles introducing
the several points]

119. 27. ea quae . . . reporta sunt. The physicians did not invent
the methods which the dog and the ibis make use of, but they devised the
application of these methods to the use os men. Cicero‘s expression is
elliptical ; the thought would be more sully expressed as follows: quae . . .
reperta sunt, lmcc a bestiis quoquc ficri virt'cmus,· nam vomitione canes
ἃς. Comp. Pliny 11. N. XXIX, 4: vomitione-s quoque lzoc animal Ιιοηιιὲ>

see note on ΙΙΙ, 7, 17; and on nuper above c. 5, 14— It is pretty gen-
erally admitted that dogs cure their indigestions by vomiting, which they
produce by eating grass; and in general many beasts possess the instinct,
when they are sick or woundcd, os eating or doing whatever will cure
them 3 and so the purgationes of the ibis may be quite true. But we can
hardly believe what is next said of the panthers and wild goats, especially
the falling out of the arrows after the animals have eaten dictamnus. Still
both circumstances are related by several ancient authors.

120. 4. odoris foeditate. The skunk cannot be meant, as that ani-
mal is found only in America ; but there are several European animals that
possess the property of producing bad odors when they are under the in-
fluence of sear.

120. 8. arborum omniumque rerum ἂι, “of trees and all other
plants.'' So very often the genus is subjoined to the individua! or the
species by the simple copula ; as Pindarus novemque lyrici . . . magni
Iovis et dearum nunt1·us,· and similar examples in Burmann on Petron. c.
2. In the absence of a word embracing the whole genus of vegetable
growths,— for planta denotes only slips, layers. ἂρ, - Cicero either uses
stirpes, which properly denotes only the trunk of the plant, or he adopts a
circumlocution. As here, so in c. 33, 83; and similarlv c. 1ο, 26 and 28.
