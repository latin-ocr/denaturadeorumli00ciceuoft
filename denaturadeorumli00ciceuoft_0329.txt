BOOK THIRD.

137. 11. Sic mehercule, “Certainly I do '’; i.e. of course 1 have pre· ἒ

pared mysels well, as I had to do to meet such an antagonist as the Stoic ;
whereas to meet an Epicurean required no particular preparation. Cotta
had said before (§ 1) that he was preparing himself during the discourse
of Balbus to reply to it: quid contra dicerem, meditabar,· and when he
remarks there, as well as below in §4‚ that he hopes not so much to refute
Balbus as to beg for further explanation on several points, we recognize
not only the Academic philosopher despairing of further knowledge, but

q the man ot' the world paying a compliment; *not without a touch of irony
too which does not escape Balbus, who answers: sin me interrogare voles
non tam intellegendi causa quam refellendi ἃς. Sic, instead of si, an
error of the copyists, is similarly used by Cicero in De Fin. III, 2, 9: iam
irfici debet iis artibus, quas si, dum est tener, combiberit, ad maiora veniet
paratior.— Sic‚· el quidem diligentins saepiusque isla loquemur inter
nos &c. ; cf. Madvig's note. See also Wopkens Lectt. Tull„ p. 171, Hand's
note.

137. 24. [accepi. Madvig proposes cepi, or rather percepi]

138. 5. ducet oratio. Comp. c. 17 init. Also pergil oratio and ilcr
sermonis De Legg. 1, 13, 37.

138. 14. Ti. Coruncanium . . . P. Scaevolam; see 1, 41, 115 note.
Scipio here mentioned is P. Cornelius Cn. s. L. n. Scipio Nasica, who was
Pontifex Maximus and Consul (563), and was once publicly pronounced
by a resolution of the Senate to be the best man in Rome. See Cic. De
Fin. V, 22, 643 Livy XXIX, 14, 8.

138. 16. C. Laelium, the famous bosom friend of Scipio Africanus the
younger, whom Cicero introduces as the speaker in his discourse on friend-
ship. He was called by his contemporaries the wise man, sapiens, and
above II, 66, 166 he is mentioned with Coruncanius, Scipio and others as
one of the good men especially beloved by the gods. His oratio nobilis,
alluded to here, was delivered in the year 600 against the proposed law of
the tribune L. Licinius Crassus who proposed to abolish the coifpmtio of
the priestly colleges of the pontifices, the augures and the decemviri sacris
