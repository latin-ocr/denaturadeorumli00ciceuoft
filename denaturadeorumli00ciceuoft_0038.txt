26 DE NATURA DEORUM.

nature of the gods. The doctrine of atonis, as being the original
elements of all things. is silly and untenable: but even granting it
to be true, and so supposing the gods to have arisen from atoms‚
their immortality would be in contradiction with it (65-68). ButA
in order to be able to maintain this immortality Epicurus takes his
usual course when he wishes to escape the consequences os his own
principles 3 he flies to other arbitrary and inconceivable propositions.
'l'he gods, says he, are not corporeal, but only quasi corporeal
beings.¹ But this quasi corporealily is a word devoid of sense, con·
veying no idea even to Epicurus and his disciples (69-75). But let
this pass, if we will. the case is no better sor the assertion that the
gods have human forms. The reasons given by the Epicureans in
support of this are next resuted one after another; and especially
the assertion, that no person can imagine the gods under any other
form, is rejected as practically false, since many represent them
under the figures of beasts (76-82). But it is quite unworthy of a
philosopher to appeal to representations of that sort. A person
might with equal justice also maintain that the gods really bear the
names that are traditionally used to denote them3 and the foolish-
ness of this is directly apparent, when we observe that the same
gods are differently called among different nations.'²

lf now we may not attribute to the gods either the human form,
as we have proved, nor in (leference to Epicurus any other form, it
would not be venturing too much to dcny their existence entirely3
yet the Epicureans do not venture this sor sear not only of men but
also of the gods themselves (83-86). But if the assertion is made
that reason can exist only in union with the human form, because
we have no experienee of it in any other shape, we may answer that it
is quite unphilosophical to maintain that a thing of which we have
no experience may not for all that have existence (87, 88).

 

1 &Vlien Cotta states that Epicurus assumes this finer bodily substance, the
quasi corpus of the gods, only for the purpose of explaining their immortality‚
it is certainly either misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation. The
immortality could only be explained according to Epicurus by the law os
isonomy: at the same time he might add that the finer eorporeal substance of
the gods was in itsels less liable to dissolution and corruption than the coarser
bodies os other things. — For another misrepresentation, that Epicurus explained
the immortality from the infinite multitude of atoms, see note to c. 39, 109.
