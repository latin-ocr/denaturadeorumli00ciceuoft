3 34 DE NATURA DEORUM.

a passing by os the impressions. The ὁμοειδία or similitudo certainly de-
notes the similarity os the nature os the impressions to that of the mind of
man, since both consist os the most minute atoms possible. Comp. Lucret.

os nature it comes that the impressions of the gods are perceived directly
and not through the medium of the coarser senses, according to the sa-
miliar principle of the old physicists similia similibus cognoscuntur ,· comp.

Metaph., p. 161. Sext. Emp. Adv. Logic. I, 116 proves that Democritus
taught this; comp. Papencordt De Atomicor. Doctr., p. 493 and doubtless
Epicurus as well.—That γνωστοὺς is precisely the correct expression sor
the perception which results from the influence os the impressions may be
seen from the letter of Epicurus to Herodotus& 68, where those things
which are perceived by the senses are called >mord κατ’ αἱσθησιν; and in
the letter to Menoecus ξ 123 the perception os the gods through the impres-
sions is called γνῶσις ἐναργὴς, whereas the proper understanding of the
nature of the gods can only be reached by reflection and reason, the gods
are only λόγῳ Hewpmol.—-Finally the words ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀποτετελεσμένωι)
certainly mean that the impressions all have the same effect (ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ
ἀποτέλεσμα ἀποτελοῦνται), the same thing that Cotta says c. 39, 109:
fluentium frequenter transitio fil visionum, ut c mullis una videatur.

Π, ¹8, 47. a medioque . . . quantum idem a summo. In order to re-
moue all the difficulty from this passage I formerly proposed an emenda-
tion, namely a medioque ubique lantundem absit extremum, striking out
quantum idem a summo, which is only found in a single Ms. in the mar-
gin. 1 mention this here only to controvert a somewhat prevalent miscon-
ception. Because Cicero, Sallust and the older authors in general only
use ubique in passages where a relative or interrogative pronoun precedes,
qui ubique and the like, and because it very osten seems as if ubique in
such passages were equivalent to et uhi, Lachmann, Lucret. IV, 638, p. 251,
has stated with his usual confidence that in the older language and even in
Cicero's time ubique could nowhere be used in any other sense, and that
it was a gross imperilia to suppose that it could as well be used in the
same manner as the other words compounded with the indefinite que, undi-
que, usque, ulerque ἃς. (a usage which still occurs in Horace, eg. Sat. 11,
5, 23). The fact in regard to Cicero and the older writers had been ob-
servcd by others long before Lachmann ; cf. Duker De Latinit. Vett.
1. Ctor.. p. 4¹5 (380 ed. 1,ips.). we may concede that in very many places
where ubique occurs aster a pronoun it may be perfectly well taken sor el
ubi: but that in any passage whatever it can be taken only in this way
