1 80 NOTEs.

consider as the πέμπτη οὐσία, quinta natura or quinta essentia (Macrob.
in Somn. Scip.1, 14, 20) the aether, tle. the fine etheric substance of
which according to Aristotle the heavenly bodies consisted, which sur-
rounded and penetrated the universe and formed according to many the
substance of the soul. According to Plato however, who takes the αἰθήρ
only sor the higher, liner air (p. 58 D), the soul comes neither from this
nor from any mixture or eonibination of the live forms os matter (comp.
'l‘rcndelenburg's note to Arist. 1)e Anim. Ι, 2, 7 p. 228); and all that the
earlier commentators have advaneed to explain the traditional reading in
the text, adnnimum efficiendum, is quite untenable. The con-eet reading
is afficiendum. For Plato explains in detail, p. 64 A to 68 C, how the dis-
serent modilications and mixtures os the elements are adapted to affect the
organs os sense and by means os these the soul (τὸ φρόνιμον, p. 64 B) and
to produce sensus, tle. perceptions.—Seusus, not senses but percqpes'ons,
as often elsewhere; comp. Acad. Ι, 11, 40: Zeno sensus csse· censuit a
quadam impulsione oblata exlrinsccus.—pariendos sensus, like dolo-
rem parcre, De Fin. 1, 15 end; somnum parere, Plin. Hist. Nat. xlx,
8, 38.

38. 21. Longum est ad omnia; dicere is omitted as in Tusc. 111,
18, 40: scd non neccsse est nunc omnia ,· ibid. IV, 20, 46: exspecto quid
ad isla sc. dicturus sis ,· and osten elscwhe=·e.—ad aliquid dicem to
speak against something. De Div. ΙΙ, 3, 8: dicendum est milii ad ea,
quae a le dicta sunl. Comp. below II, 1, 1.

20 38. 22. Sed illa palmaris [Schoemann's reading sor palmaria]‚
“worthy of the palm‚” ιζε. the prize os x·ictory; ironically of course. But it
is very doubtful whether Cicero really wrote thus, supplying mentally
sententia from ξ 18, or res (as Zumpt thinks, ad l‘errin, p. 297 and
p. 700). Perhaps he wrote: scd illud palmare cst, or illa palmaria as
Baiter and Madvig prefe1·; for although Plato’s assertion is a single one,
yet it might have been made several times and in several sentences
(p. 32 C, 33 Α, 41 A) and so be indicated by a plural.

38. 26. physiologiam, not what is called so nonna-days, but natural
science. Comp. De Div. Ι, 41, 90: natm-ac· rationem, quam physiolqgiam
Graeci appellant. — Morem-er Plato (Timaeus, p. 41, A) expressly recog-
nizes the law which Velleius reproaches him with being ignorant of; but
he still ascribes to the highest God, the creator of the world, the power of
endowing what he has created with eternal existence.

38. 28. qnid est . . . nihil sit, extremum 2> The question, equiva-
lent to a negation, relates properly only to the second number os the sen-
tence, cuius nihil sil extremum .· the first, cuius principium aliquod sit,
gives the circumstances under which that question is asked. Cicero might
