οὑ κατὰ τὸν αὑτὸν τρόπον, ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ ὠν μὲν κατὰ τὰς ῥίζας, ἐφ’ ὠν ὁὶ· κατὰ
τὴν κόμην, ἐφ’ ὼν δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἐγκάρδιον. ”Ωστε, ἐπεὶ καὶ o' κόσμος ὑπὸ φῦσεως
διοικεῖται πολυμερὴς καθεστώς, εἰη dv τι ἑν αὐτῷ τὸ κυριεῦον καὶ τὸ προκαταρ-
χόμενον τῶν κινήσεων οὐδὲν δὲ δυνατὸν εἶναι τοιοῦτον ὴ τὴν τῶν ὀντων φῦσιν,
ἣτις θεός ἐστιν, Kiihner]

87. 34. omnem vim mundi natura divina contium-u “the uni· 30
verse, with all that pertains to its being and idea, depends for its existence
and maintenance upon a divine being that pervades it.” For contineri
comp. ξ 29 init. Instead of it we have ξ 28 init. sustinerz',· below retineri:
and ξ 31 teneri‚· which all come to the same thing.

88. 1. ad sensus commovendos. The phrase in the Greek original
was perhaps πρὸς κίνησιν αἰσθήσεως οι· αἰσθητικὴν, i.e. for the activity of
the perception and consciousness ; whereas Cicero’s words have reference
rather to a working on the senses, which is not in question here.

88. 2. hic noster calor, i.e. the natural heat that pervades the world
immediately surrounding us, the earthly beings; not the common fire as
opposed to the elemental fite, as a recent commentator imagines. For this
common fire according to ξ 41 is conseclor consumptorque omnium‚whereas
lzic noster calor is that heat which preserves and vivifies things, the θερμότης
ψυχικὴ, as Aristotle calls it, De Gen. Anim. ΙΙΙ, 11. Comp. above p. 73,
Remark.

88. 9. mundo valentius. Comp. Ps. Aristot. De Mundo c. 5: τίς 31
γὰρ ἂν εἰη φί’σις τοῦδε (miv κόσμον) κρείττων.

88. 10. Audiamus enim Platonem. The following proposition from ἐξ
Plato is not cited apropos of what immediately precedes, nam quid. . .
teneatur, which is rather to be regarded as a sort of parenthesis; but of
the clause preceding that, namely praesertim cum . . . moveatur, and to
give the reason why this clause was presented as the chief argument for the
proposition that the mundi ardor (αἰθήρ) is a being endowed with percep-
tion and thought. The passage of Plato which Cicero refers to is found in
phaedr„ p. 245 C, ξ 51, and is translated Tuse. Ι, 23.—For esse before
ponit, which some have objected to, comp. Acad. Ι, 5, 19: corporis autem
alia ponebant esse in loto, alia in partibus ,· and other examples in Madvig
De Fin. V, 25, 73.

88. 26. inchoatis: imperfi’ctis. Comp. De Leg. Ι, 9, 27: prima el 33
inchoata intellegentia ,· Off. I, 43, 15 3: cognitio manca et inchoata.

88. 28. Primum enim. Instead of the corresponding secundo or
deinde we have ξ 34 autem as very often happens —The order of beings
here corresponds to the order of their souls, which the Stoics distinguished,
therein agreeing with Aristotle. Plants are endowed with a ψυχὴ ‹pm-tm) or
