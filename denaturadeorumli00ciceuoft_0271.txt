BOOK 11.—C11AP. VIII, §5 18-21. 239

84. 26. aestus mar-itinn, the ebb and flow os the ocean. See ΙΙΙ,
10, 24. Similar movements of the sea occur in some narrow passages in
the Mediterraneum, as in the Euripus and the Fretum Siculum ; also in the
Adriatic sea according to Strabo V, 1, 5, p. 212. Hence the expression
fretorum angustiae. The old naturalists generally held that these move-
ments were caused by the influence of the moon: τῶν περὶ τὸν ὠκεανὸν
πλημμυρίὸων καὶ ὰμπώτεων αὕτη (ἡ σελήνη) airia ἐστί, says Cleomedes in the
treatise on the phenomena of the heavens, ΙΙ, 1, p. 105 ; and Bake, p. 416
cites several others. [Comp. De Div. 11, 14, 34: Quid de fretis aut de
marinis aestibus plura dicam ,9 quorum accessus et recessus lunae motu
gubernantur]

84. 27. una totius caeli conver-smne cursus astrorum dispares.
The stars have an apparent motion with the whole heavens around the
earth, but not all at the same rate. The greater part os them move so that
they always keep the same place in the heavens, thus mox-ing only along
with the heavens, and these are called stellae fixae ,· others move in such
manner that while moving along with the heavens around the earth they
have an independent motion of their own, and are seen now here and now
there ; they are therefore called planetae. But these cursus dispares also
follow an established law; hence the expression conservari. Comp.
c. 20, 51·

84. 30. et continuato. The adjective is thus placed in order to
bring out more pointedly the idea that the soul of the universe is to be con-
ceived as a confinuous, undivided whole.

84. 31. fusius is sometimes wrongly translated “at greater length'’;
it means “in loose discoume, not confined to a strict order and division.''
Cic. De Leg. Ι, 13, 36: quae fuse olim disputabantur αι· libere, ea nunc ar-
ticulatim dissecta dictmlur. See Bake‘s remark. [But uberius and fu-
sius seem to be opposed here to brevius and angustius in the next sentence.
So Orat. II, 38, 159 : et genus sermonis affi⁹rl Stoicus non liquidum, non
fusum ac prtfiuens‚ sed exile, aridum, concisum ac minutum ,· Quint. ΙΙ,
4, 7 : materia abundantior atque ultra quam oporteat susa. See the ex-
amples in Harpers' Latin Dictionary s. v.—Aeademicorum calum-
niam. So Aead. ΙΙ, 5, 14 : Arcesilae calumnia]

84. 34. ut profluens amnis. A similar comparison occurs in Quint.
XII, 2, 11.

85. 3. Zeno. His own words are cited in Sext. Emp. IX, 104. Diog.
L. VII, 143, ascribes the same argumentation to Chrysippus, Apollodorus
and Posidonius

85. 8. quae sunt iis carentia. A structura ad sensum ,· for the
