165. ²9- expetantur eae poenae a liberis ἃς. Hom. Il. IV, 160:
εἴπερ γάρ τε καὶ αὐτίκ’ Ὀλὺμπιος οὐκ ἐτέλεσσεν, ἑκ ti& καὶ ὀψὲ τελεῖ, aiv τε
μεγάλῳ ἀπέτισαν σῐνν σφῇσιν κεφαλῇσι γυναιξί τε καὶ τεκέεσσιν, Cf. 1 Mos.
20, 5 ; and Plutarch De Sera Summi Numinis Vindicta.

165. 33. Qulnam Tantalidarum. The verses are from Attius, as
Charisius I, p. 70 shows: but it is uncertain srom which play.

106. 3. portenta et flagitia. See 1, 11, 235 16, 43; 24, 66.

166. 4. Hipponactis iambus; Hipponax of Ephesus, about 540 ΒΩ,
inventor of the choliambus and writer os satirical poems against his per—
sonal enemies. Cicero says iambus because the choliambus is also an
iambus, and the latter name is sometimes given to any satirical poem.—
Archilochus mentioned afterward, os Paros about 700, was the reputed
inventor of the iambus, and satirized his enemies iu his poems with such
bitterness that some of them are said to have committed suicide from vex-
ation and shame.

166. 11. ab Apolline potius, for Lycurgus was said to have been,
called to lawgiving and instrueted by the Delphian Apollo. Herod. Ι, 65 ;
Plut. Lyc. c. 133 Plat. Leg. init.

166. 11. Critolaus, an Achaean general, unable to bear the presump-
tion of the Romans who intersered in Graeciam affairs especially between
the Achaeans and the Laccdaemonians as judges and attempted to control
them by no means impartially, brought on the outbreak os the war which
ended in the destruction os Corinth.

166. 12. Hasdrubal, a Carthaginian general in the war against Ma-
sinissa os Numidia, the ally os thc Roman53 this war gave the Romans
the pretext for the third Punic war.

166. 17. ut enim hominum membra ἃς. The same comparison
occurs also De Div. 1, 53, 120: si animal omne ut vult ita utitur motu sui
corporis prono, obliquo, supino, membraque quocunque vult flectit, con-
torquet, porrigy‘t, contrahit, eaque ante afficit paene quam cogitat, quanto id
deo est facilius, cuius numini parent omnia. A'umen very properly de-
notes the effective power of the gods; the same word is used by Lucretius
111, 144 os the power of the soul over the body: corpus paret et ad numen
mentis nomenque* movetur. The proper meaning is τ nutus, “ nod‚’'
whence the derived meaning is easily explained ; and nutus mentis in Lae·
tantius De Opis. Dei, c. 7: nervi quibus mens . . ‚minimo nutu totius
corporis molem temperat ac flectit.

166. 20. materiam enim rer-um ἃς. For explanation os the pas-
sage cs. Cic. Acad. ῐ, 7, 27: subiectam putant ( l‘em'patctici et veteres
Academici) omnihus sinc ulla ttpccie atquc carentem amm· qualitate ma-
