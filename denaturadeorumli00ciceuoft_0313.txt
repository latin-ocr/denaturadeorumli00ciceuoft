BOOK II.——-C11A1·. LIV, LV, ἐξ 134—136. 279

122. 24. depulsum . . . depellit. The use os the same word twice
at so short an interval, where it would have been easy to use, sor depellit,
perhaps deglulil, or sor depulsum, depressum (as liiineinann on Lact. De
Opis. Dei, c. 10, 16 proposed), is evidently a fault which is only explained
by the haste and carelessness with which Cicero wrote this part os the book
devoted to anatomy‚ and of which there are many other traces. Comp.
note on c. 58, ¹45·

122. 31. quodam operculo, the epigiottis, Gr. ἑπιγλωττῐς. See Gell. 136
XVII, 11 where various views are mentioned in regard to its use.

122. 33. alvi natura. Comp. De Fin. V, 11, 33: hoc intellegant, si
quando naturam hominis dicam, hominem dicere me ,· nihil enim hoc dif-
fert: Lucret. 1, 276: cum mollis aquae ftrlur natura repenle flumine
abundanti. It is easy to see that such a circumlocution would not be
everywhere admissible; it is only so where the object is considered in
respect to its natural constitution and purpose—alvus means here the
stomach‚ but sarther on (multiplex et tortuosa) the bowels ; the term there·
sore includes both the ventriculus and the intestina. Alvus superior is
used sor the stomach in Cato R. R. 156. Greek ἡ ἀνω κοιλία and ἦ κάτω
κοιλία,

122. 34. pulmones et cor . . . spiritum ducant. The part which
the heart was supposed to bear in the process of breathing is given more
definitely below c. 55, 138. Itis of course one of the many errors in this
part of the book ς to note them all would require too much space and be
of little use.

123. 9. [The Mss. have in re spiritu which Lamh, Schoemann and 55
Miiller correct to in respz'ralu, Madvig and Baiter to intrante spiritu]
tum se contrahunt adspirantes, tum in respiratu dilatant. Above
c. 54, 136 the word respiret is plainly used of breathing oul. exhaling the air
already in the lungs; and likewise below in ξ 138. Adspirare however
in cases where it seems to mean this really means only the breathing upon
something, adstare, adhalare, as De Div. 1, 36, 79, where the influences
are spoken os quaefiunl ex disparili adspiratione terrarum. Comp. ibid.
57, 130 ; and above c. 33, 83 adspiratio aeris where the point is not so much
the inkaling as the influence of the air which is necessary to the growth
of animals in breathing and in other ways. Respz'rare too is never used
really for inlmling· as opposed to exholing, but only of breathing in gen-
eral, the spiritus reciprocatio (Geli. XVII, 11, 4) in which the others
alternate; or it means to recover the breath after the breathing has
been sor a time interrupted. In the present passage Cicero meant by ad·
spirantes only the breathing upon something. He avoided the word
