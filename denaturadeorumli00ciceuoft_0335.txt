143. 1. Nihil est mundo mellus in rerum natura. Balbus says
ΙΙ, 12, 32: mundus melior (esl) quam ulla natura, and mundum univer-
sum pluris esse necesse est quam partem aliquam universi ,· but he no-
where uses the peculiar expression chosen by Cotta, which really amounts
to only this, nihil est mundo melius in mundo. This includes, it is true,
nulla pars mundi est mundo melior ‚¹ but Cotta evidently uses it with the
object of offsetting it with his own as a complete counterpart ; namely, A'e
in terris quidem urbe nostra, scil. quicquam melius est ,· although the rela-
tions os the objects compared together in the two sentences, mundus to
rerum naturae, and urbs nostra to terrae, are essentially different.—The
following argumentation, which agrees completely with that of Alexinus
given by Sext. Emp. IX, 108, deserves the name of calumnia which
Balbus applies to similar ones 11, 7, 20. It grossly misuses the word
melius, which os course may mean very different things as applied to dif-
ferent objects and relations; and by taking it in some os its relative signi·
i fications and applying it to the universe one may sueceed in throwing an
appearance of ridicule on the opinion of the Stoics; but this vanishes as
soon as the word is taken in the sense which the Stoics intended. Comp.

143. 8. Istum locum Zenonis conclusio . . . dilatavit. [Schoe-
mann reads dilatabit with the following note] “Zeno‘s conclusion will
widen the application of that proposition ⁷¹ ; i.e. by means of Zeno's conclu-
sion the proposition can be made to include more than you would wish ; it
can be used to prove not only that the universe is intelligent but also that it
can read Sto. The expression may be compared with 1, 35, 98: si semel
susceperimus genus lzoc argumenti, atlemle quo serpat. Dilatore is to
make a wider application os a thing; so in De Leg. ΙΙΙ, 14, 32: lex dila-
tata in ordinem cunctum. The ‹lilalavit os the Mss. is evidently false;
no one would imagine that Zeno so turned the proposition. Nor can dila-
tavit be equivalent to effmit ul dilatari possit. [We have kept the reading
dilatavit of Miiller, which is also given by Baiter in both editions. In a
note Miiller proposes the present, i.e. locus conclusione clz‘lalatur. There
seems to be no valid objection against the perfect, the sense being that
Zeno's way of putting the argument has made it possible to extend its ap-
plication farther than he intended]

143. 19. Saepe dixti. The syncopated form is also found in the Mss.
of Cicero De Fin. ΙΙ, 3. 10¹, Ad Att. XIII, 32 ; Pro Caecin. 29, 82. Comp.
