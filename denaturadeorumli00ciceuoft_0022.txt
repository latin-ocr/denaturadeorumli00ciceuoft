persons, and not simply names; and secondly it does not touch
them 311, 1101· does it touch the system at all. The only idea in har-
mony with the system was that the origin of all virtue and wisdom
is in the one highest, the only true God. Man, whose spirit is an
emanation from the divine being,¹ bears within him for this reason
the capacity for virtue and wisdom: but this is much restrained and
borne down by the body to which it is bound3 and the task of man
is to break loose from the fetters. But there was in the system of
the Stoic theology no clear decision whether in this task man must
rely simply on himself and his own power, that is on the power of
the indwelling divine being, or whether he could have the comfort-
ing aid of friendly gods; and a person might think as he pleased on
this question.² It is undoubtedly true that we very often find among
the 510165 proud utterances, which seem to imply a presuming arro-
gance, a sels-sufficient reliance upon ones own power, sar removed

and modesty of the heathen3 but we must not 01611001( 1116 fact that

the reference is only to the wise man, or the man in whom the ideal
of human perfectiori is realized 3 an ideal which the individua! rarely
or never succeeds in reaching. But the Stoic Balbus (Cic. N. D.
11, 66) states very plainly that in the struggle for perfection man
needs the help of those higher powers that are kindly disposed
towards him and are free from the imperfections and saults of human
nature; and the 3556111011, 11131 we must rely upon ourselves and our
