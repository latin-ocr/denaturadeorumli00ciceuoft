represented a Greek, the poet certainly erred in making the speaker refer
to the Romans as nostri, and so to the Greeks as strangers. The criticism
of Cicero is just. The following words At Latine loquitur contain an ob-
jection to this criticism‚ which is however immediately answered. This
objection, says Cicero, would only hold if we were not obliged really to
imagine the speaker as a Greek; but the poet himself in the following
verse of the same piece shows us expressly that we. must do s0.-Evi-
dently the whole digression is introduced to give an appearance of the
greater ease of friendly conversation, as also in 111, 10, 25.

107. ¹7· ex aethere . . . existunt. Comp. c. 15 init.

107. 22. mota loco for moti, the speaker still thinking of sidera.

107. 23. conflagrare. Cicero was writing hastily and left out of
account the possible alternative that the earth might also grow cold if the
sun were to move away from it.

107. 29. unius et viginti . . . litterarum. That is the number of
letters in the Latin alphabet; for Y and Z are foreign to the Latin lan-
guage and only used in Greek words; so that Quintil. 1, 4, 9 calls X the
last of the Latin letters. Comp. Priscian Ι, 15 and Corssen iil). Aussprache
&e.; 1, p. 7. [For the order of the words adjectives with adjectives &c-
comp. Phil. ΙΙ, 27, 66: permagnum optimi pondus argenti ,· Liv. 10, 46:
frequenti publicorum ornatu locorum ,· Niigelsbaeh Lat. Styl., p. 466.]

107.31. annales Ennii. An epic poem containing the Roman his· ,

tory up to the time of the poet, the beginning of the sixth century.

107. 32- quod nescio. The relative pronoun serves to recall what
precedes, in this case posse. . . annales Ennii {ffi‘is and the sentence
would be grammatically complete without the following words tantum va-

note c. 9, 24.

108. 1. quam ποιότητα Graeci vocant. Cicero adds this remark
because the Greek word was quite familiar to his readers, but the Latin
word was first coined by himself, as he says Acad. 1, 6, 24, where he reck-
ons it among the verbis inauditis. The Greek ποιότης too was first coined
by Plato, as is remarked in his life in XVestermann’s Biogr., p. 393, as well
as in other places. The word occurs in Theaet., p. 182 A, where Plato him-
self calls it an ἀλλόκοτον ὄνομα.

108. 9. qui locus est proximus, according to the division given
above c. 30, 75. As Balbus has in fact been treating of this part of the
argument since c. 36, he calls attention to it as it were in a supplementar5
way. This is not to be regarded as an error of Cicero, but is a part of

the imitation of extempore discourse, which very well admits of the fusius
disputare (see note c. 7, 20).
