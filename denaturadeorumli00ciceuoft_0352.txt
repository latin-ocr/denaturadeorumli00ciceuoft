64 156. 1. Neptunum esse (ficis animum sce. This refers to ΙΙ, 28, 71,
where the language differs, but the sense is the same. The phrase idem
de Cerere is only a passing hint, which the reader is expected to complete
sor himself.

156. 6. qualis tu eos esse vis. After these words something has
evidently fallen out: mm esse scio, or the like.

65 156. 15. After Sed there is a long break, comprising the whole third
part of the argument, setting forth the objections against the divine provi-
dence, and a part of the fourth, against the particular care of the gods sor
men ; all of which is lost.

66 156. 16. Nequaquam istuc istae ibit ἃς. From the Medea Exul of

Ennius, corresponding to vv. 363 ff. of the tragedy os Euripides: ἀλλ’ οῡτι
ταύτῃ ταῦτα, μὴ δοκεῖτέ πω. ἐτ’ εὶσ’ ἀγῶνες τοῖς νεωστὶ νυμφίοις, καὶ τοῖσι
remisi-<mom οἱ) σί’κρίὶ πόνοι, δοκεῖς γὰρ ἂν με τόνδε (nominaui ποτ’ ἁιι;-
The following ille traversa. mente ἃς. corne from the same source and
correspond to vv. 371, 39S-9 of Euripides, although the translation in both
czsses is not quite correct. The remaining verses in ξς 66 and 67 have no
corresponding ones in the Medea os Euripides; but they may still have
existed in that of Ennius, inasmuch as the plays of the Roman dramatists
were not simple translations, but more or less free adaptations of the Greek
originals.

68 ¹57· ¹7· maior mihi moles διε. From the Atreus of Attius, cited
also in De Orat. 111, 58 and Tusc. IV, 36.

27 157. 21. This and the eight following verses are from the same tragedy
of Attius. They are the words of Atreus, who complains of his brother
Thyestes for having seduced his wife Αὲῐορε. lHexe, an old syncopated
form sor z'llexisse ,· so despexe Plaut. Mil. Glor. Π, 6, 72, surrexe Hor. Sat.
I, 9, 73, divisse II, 3, 169, and other similar examples in Lucretius. —The
succeeding verses Adde huc ἃς. refer to another crime of Thyestes.
Atreus had received stom Hermes a ram with golden wool, on the posses-
sion os which the duration of his authority depended. Thyestes with the
aid of Aerope stole it.

69 158. 1. Videtur-ne. Occasionally a question is introduced by the
simple enclitic ne where an affirmative answer is expected and nonne
might be used in its place. Cf. De Offic. ΙΙΙ, 17, 68: suntne igitur insi-
diae, tendere plagas, and the remarks of Heusinger and Beier. Videsne?
Videtisne? are especially common. So in German Sielzst du wohl? might
often be used for Sielzst du nicht? See ΙΙ, 28 init.‚ and below c. 34, 83;
Tusc. 11, 11, 26; 21, 505 22, 533 Rosc. Am. c. 24, 66; Hand Turseli.
