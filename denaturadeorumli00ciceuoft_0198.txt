1 72 Norsss.

The Latin seems to have had no single word to express the vegetable king-
dom. Cieero uses several circumlocutions; 11, 33, 83: ea quae a terra
stirpibus continentur ,· 11, 1ο, 28: ea quorum stirpes terra continentur ,-
De Fin. lv, 5, 13: res eae quae gignuntur e terra ‚· N. D. 11, 13, 36: stirpes
alone ; Sallust Jug. 70, 6: gignentia. See Nagelshach, Lateinische Stilis-
tik, § 36, 1, 2.]

33. 29. quae dicentur in h1s libr-Is. See 11, 62, 156 seqq—ea
ipsa, these things exactly as they are.

33. 30. fabricati paene, i.e. paene firbrili opcra ff·cisse‚ with
artistic plan and care.

33. 31. Carneades os Cyrene, head os the Aeademy at Athens about
the middle os the second century ire. His negative criticism, on which it
may suffice sor the moment to refer to c. 5, 11, was directed especially
against the Stoics and their leader Chrysippus. Compare also 11, 65, 162
and 111, 17, 44. He wrote nothing except sorne letters to the Cappadocian
king Ariarffies, but his leetures were reported by listeners and published. i

33. 31. ita goes with disseruit, not with mulla ,· it points to the char-
acter of his arguments, which were such ul excitaret (sc. Carneades)
homines ἃς. For the arrangement of the words compare Verr. 11, 3, 8:
magistralutnn nostrorum iniurias ila mullorum tulto-unt, ut numquam
ante lzoc tempus ad aram legum . . . conflige-rint.

34. 1. Qua quidem in causa. The idea may be better defined by
mentally supplying tractanda. Cicero says: While undertaking this dis·
cussion I am quite in a position to defend myself from any one who
blames me sor it.—1t is entirely erroneous to refer this expression, as
many have done, to the Stoics and Epicureans.

34. 2. [benivolos. So Miiller writes here, and in I, 21, 58, 44, 122
from the Mss. Both bene- and beni- are correct, but the former became
the recognized form from the first century of the empire. Brambach.]

34. 6. [brevi tempore edidimus. See Introduction, p. 19.]

34. 10. eam . . . philosophiam, i.e. Academia-am. In Acad. 11, 19,
61 Cicero represents Lucullus as saying to him: Tunc eam philosophiam
sequere, quae confundit vcra cum salsis, spoliat nos iudicio, privat appro-
batione, omnibus orbat sensibus .>⁹—The dative rebus is not to be taken
with lucem eriperet on account of the order os the w01·ds; we might rather
supply a dative like nobis or hominibus. Compare Acad. 11, 1ο, 30: quid
eum facturum putem de abditis rebus et obscuris, qui lusem eripere conetur ,Ρ
ibid. 32, 105: non cuim lucem eripimus: sed ca, quae ros percipi, eadem
nos videri dicimus ,· and 103: ab Academia sensus eripi. Compare Liv. X,
32: nebula erat—densa adeo, ut lucis usum eriperet.
