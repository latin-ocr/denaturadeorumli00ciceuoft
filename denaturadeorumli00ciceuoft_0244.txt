but corresponds to etiam, as Cicero sometimes uses it, at least in the philo-
sophical writings and in the letters. Cornp. Hand 11, 513, 517; and
Kiihner's note to Tusc. 111, 13, 28. After speaking previously of the form
under which the gods are conceived he passes on to their various appel-
lations. For the indicative in this form of question compare above c. 29,
80 (arbitramur); below c. 32, 90 (putamus) and further Madvig on Cic.

dicendum est ,· and inore in Hand Tursell. ΙΙΙ, p. 485. [De Fin. 1, 7, 26 :

57. 7. ipsum sibi displicere. tibi would have been more exact;
but what precedes really applies not so much to Velleius, as to the Epicu-
reans in general.

[Haec vestra sunt. There seems to be something wrong here.
Cotta has just smished his refutation of the Epicurean doctrine that the gods
have human forms; he asks, l. 7, :In lu mci similem putas esse aut tui
deum? and answers himself, Profecto non putas. He then asks, Quid ¹
ergo?—-do you think the sun and moon are gods ? and shows this to be
absurd. Then according to the common reading he says, llaec vestra sunt.
But these doctrines last mentioned are not Epicurean doctrines, vestra, i.e.
os Velleius and his sect. Then in the next sentence he goes on ε If they
have not human forms, as Ι have shown, nor any such forms (tali aliquo),
which you are quite certain of &ew The words nec tali aliquo refer to
solem aut lunam aut caelum ,· but they must refer to some view which Vel-
leius did not accept as true ; and the words llaec vestra sunt state the con-
trary of what would be expected. Possibly they should be a question ; or
is the reading of the Ms. Ι (ed. Moser) the true one, llaec vera sunt ἒ]

57. 12. humano (visu) :humana specie. As the Mss. here have a
break, the word to be inserted is by no means sure; it might be corpore.
But the emendation venerantes for numerantes is certain.

57. 17. Itaque ἃς. It is clear that the simple quotation in this sen-
tence is not properly that which is to serve as proof of the view just men·
tioned in the preceding, but that such proof consists in the supposed
intentional ambiguity of Epicurus, which is afterwards spoken of. This
connection of thought would have been more properly expressed as fol-
lows: Itaque cum in illis selectis eius brevibusque sententiis . . . prima
sententia sit. . . in lcac ita exposita sententia δια-οη the κίνρ. ὁόξ. see
