3 10 NOTES.

Christian apologists are very fond of making use of it in argument. Many
passages might be cited from Clem. Alex. (Protrept.), from Arnobius, Lac-
tantius and others, from L. Ampelius (Liber illcmorz'aIIs), and johannes
Lydus (De ⁴llens.), some of which support, others contradict the indications
given by Cicero. The only point to be noticed here is that under all the
names hereafter mentioned, even Aether, Caelus, Sol and the like, accord-
ing to the doctrine of Euhemerus, we are to understand human beings of
former ages who actually bore those names.

152. 33. cuius . . . sepulcrum ostenditur. Callimachus expresses
indignation at this, Hymn. in Iov. v. 8: Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψευσταί· καὶ γὰρ τά-
φον, ὡ ἀνα, ocio Κρῆτες ἑτεκτὴιναντψ oi· δ’ oi* θάνες· ἐσσὶ γὰρ alei.

152. 35. qui appellantur Anaces Athenis. The name has the
same meaning apparently as Ἀι-(ικτες. Their temple at Athens, τὸ Ἀνα-
κεὶον, is often mentioned; but they are not generally distinguished from
the Tyndaridae. Cf. Plut. Thes. c. 33 ; Num. c. 13.

153. 1. [Tritopatreus‚ a son of Jupiter by Proserpine. Sehoemann
reads Tritopalores, [Zagreusffl Eubuleus, Dionysus, with the following
notet] Tritopatores‚ properly “ancestors” (Pollux 111, 7). The name
seems to have been applied in long-forgotten theogonies to certain deities
to whom the origin of the human race was attributed. Cf. Lobeck Agl„
pp. 754—765, according to whose opinion Zagreus, wanting in the Mss.‚ is
here inserted in the text. It is impossible to explain with certainty or to
form an opinion upon the statements here made by Cotta on the authority ’
of his theologi, εὖ we have no knowledge of the data which formed the
basis of their opinions. [See also Preller, Griech. Myth. Ι, 371.]

54 ¹53· 12. quae Heliopolis appellatur. The Aegyptian name was
On, at the same tinne the name of the god. According to Jablonski,
Panth. Aeg. 1, p. 137, it means “ light.”

¹53· 13· quem Acantho Rhodi. The name does not occur else-
where ; it is singular too that the father's name is not mentioned with the
mother's ; the passage is (loubtless corrupt, and it is impossible to restore it.

ω 153- 16. Apollinem eum. There is no verb here to govern the ac-

cusative; sor the following esse voluerunt belongs only to the relative
clause, which was itself the cause of the omission. It would have been
very easy to supply it, as it must have been some word of the same mean-
ing as esse voluerunt. A case of anacoluthia not unlike this is found in
Brut. c. 27, 105: llunc qui audierant prudentes homines, in quibus fit-
miliaris noster L. Gellius, qui se illi contubernalem in consulatu fuisse
narrabat, canorum oratorem el volubilem sitisse dicebat. Here the predi-
cate is wanting for homiues. It would be dicebant,· butj the following
