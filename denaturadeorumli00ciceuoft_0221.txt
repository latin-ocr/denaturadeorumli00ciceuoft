υοῐις·, ascribing however the highest intellectual and moral perfection not
to this νοῦς, but to a later stage os development. Nothing more is known
of his views, and we cannot be certain whether qua omnia regantur is
really said here in the same sense as he intended it.

42. 20. in tertio de philosophia libro. This work is no longer 33
extant. 1t was one of the popular works written in the form of a dia-
logue. See Bernays, Die Dialoge des Arist„ pp. 95 and 99.

42, 22. menti, iz. the highest intelligence, the pure, incorporeal spirit,
νοῦς. Metaph. XII, 6. 7. 9.

42. 23. mundum ipsum deum esse. Aristotle nowhere asserts that
the universe is God: but he calls the heavens ἀθάνατόν τι καὶ θεῖον, De
Caelo IL 1, 3.

42. 23. alium quendam. He means probably what Aristotle in
Meteor. I, 3 and De Caelo II, 4 calls πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, πρῶτον τῶν σωμά-
των, an οὐσία σώματος ἀλλη παρὰ τὰς ἐι :awa (Le. ἐν τῇ γῇ) συστᾴσεις θειο-
τέρα καῐ προτέρα (De Caelo 1, 2), the quinta natura mentioned above
(note to c. 8, 19), which occupies the space above the moon, and from
which are formed the heavenly bodies and their spheres. This nobler,
godlike elementis endowed with a circular motion, which explains the revo-
lution of the beaveris and the heavenly bodies; and it is this motion which
is here designated. by replicatio, a motion returning upon itself. Comp.
Stob. EcL Phys. 1, p. 64 and especially Plut. Plac. Phil. Ι, 7.

42. 25. caeli ardorem. Only another name for the substance just
spoken of, which Aristotle himself (De Caelo Ι, 3) explains to be what
others call aether. On this expression see note to c. 8, 18.

42. 28. nu tot di. By this expression it is impossible to understand
the three J'US‘c mentioned, the mundus, the governor of the mundus, and
the caeli a⁴fdor. Theresore some passage must have been lost in which
heavenlf bodies were probably spoken of ; and those, being formed of a
divine matter, might themselves be called divine (θεῖα, δαιμόνια). Comp.
StOb- Flcl. Phys. Ι, p. 486, where they are also called θεοί.

47ι. 32. semper se movens. According to Aristotle the supreme
GO‘U is himself without motion, but is himself the cause of the motion of
fl'ie universe. The Epicurean could not quite understand anything that
'caused motion, being itselx' immovable ; hence he says se movens.

4²· 33. Xenocrates οῖ’ Chalcedon, disciple of Plato (hence condis· 34
cipulus of Aristotle), and successor of Speusippus as teacher in the Aca d-
emy after Bc. 339.

42. 35. deos enim octo esse dicit. The account of the theology of
Xenocrates is very incomplete3 it is more fully given in Stob. Ecl. 1,
p. 62. At the head he placed the μονάς and the δυάς, the unity and the
