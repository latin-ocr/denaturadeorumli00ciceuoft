would seem from this passage that they took it from Epicurus. See Diog.
L. VII, 54.

igitur ,· and we should expect, in harmony with what precedes, habere,
parallel with lzanc nos habere.

46. 9. [ipsorum deorum; so also Baiter, z'.e. “the existence of the
gods.’' Schoemann has deorum ipsorum]

46. 12. ab Epicuro. In the so-called κυρίαις δόξαις (see c. 30, 85)
i.e. the principal points of his doctrine, preserved by Diog. L. X, 139 ff.
The first of these is: τὸ μακάριον καὶ ἁφθαρτυυ οὗτε αὐτὸ πράγματα ἔχει οὗτε
ἄλλῳ παρέχει, ὥστε οὗτε ὀργαῖς οὒτε χάρισι συνέχεται· ἑν ἀσθενεῖ γὰρ πᾶν τὸ
τοιοῦτον.

46. 16. [satiS erat dietum. For the indicative in the apodosis see
Madvig Gr. 348, Obs.; Roby, 1535]

46. 18. habet venerationem. So luctum habere (De Leg. ΙΙ, 26,
65), delectationem, admirationem, exspectationem, laetitiam, spem, tinu—
rem habere (Ad Famil. V, 12, 18) and the like are said of things which
give rise to those feelings. Comp. Beier on De Offie. II, 6, 9.—a vi
atque ira goes with metus,¹ as metuere ab aliquo, “to be afraid of a per·
son.”

46. 23. vitae actionem, as in 1, 1, 2 and 37, 103, “manner of life.'⁷

46. 26. occurrit. In ξ 46 we shall see how this is to be understood. {g

46. 27. ne omnia revocentur ad primas notiones, “not to explain
everything by reference to primary ideas.” The prirnary ideas are the

exposes the weakness of the argument c. 32, 89. 90.

46. 30. eandem equivalent to item, as Brut. 84, 290: rVon omnes qui 47
Attice, iidem bene dicunt. See Reisig, ξ 210; Mad. Gr. 488.

46. 33. Vos quidem, Lucili, soletis &c.; Balbus too does so in 11,
54 ff-

46. 33. Cotta meus modo hoc modo illud. Comp. De Div. Ι, 30, 48
62: lVomque Carneades concertationis studio modo hoc modo illud ait: Ad
Attic. XIII, 25, 3: O Academiam volaticam et sui similem ,· modo lzuc

47. 7. quasi corpus . . . quasi sanguinem. According to Epicu· 49
rus the mind too is material as well as the body, and consists like all other
