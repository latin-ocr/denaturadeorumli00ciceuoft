74 DE NATURA DEORUM.

powerful than that which exists in earthly things and which pro-
duces life and consciousness in men and animals, and so all the
more sensitive, conscious and thinking. And since it derives its
spring of action not from something external but from itself; and
since whatever is the source of its own activity is, as Plato teaches‚
soul; the principle of heat is to be regarded as the soul of the uni-
verse, and the universe as a being possessing a soul (31, 32) : it is
at the same time a reasonable and wise being, because the universe
must surely be better than the individual beings which it contain53
while if it were not reasonable and wise, it would follow that man
by the possession of reason would thereby have the preeininence
over the universe (32).—A further proof of the existence of the
deity is drawn froin the observed gradation of beings‚ the higher
succeeding the lower, the more perfect the more imperfect3 the
sensitive animal, moved by instincts and desires, standing above the t
plant which merely grows and nourishes itself, and man endowed
with reason standing above the animal. In like manner there must
be above man a higher gracie of beings who are possessed of reason
in the highest fullness‚ which in man is only incomplete. This
grade is that of the deity, hence of the universe which is the deity
and whose perfectiori cannot, like that of subordinate natures‚ be
diminished by any limitations or defects whatever (33-36). To
strengthen this argument the absurdity and iinpossibility of the
contrary suppositionis pointed out3 as also the necessity that the
universe, as the all-embracing all must be perfect in every respect,
hence reasonable and wise, and hence God (37—39).

After the divinity of the universe has thus been shown, there fol-
lows the proof that the heavenly bodies are also gods. As these
consist entirely of the finest ether i.e. the warm principle of tire,
they must consequently be living, sensitive and thinking beings.
This is true first of the sun, the ethery‚ fiery nature of which can-
not be doubted (40, 41) ; the other heavenly bodies are also of the
substance of ether, hence sensitive and thinking (42). This how-
ever follows also from the order and regularity of their mossons,

 

fire derived from the original fire, as they exist in the heavenly bodies and in
earthly things„ Anything more definite than this wc arc unable to ascertain
