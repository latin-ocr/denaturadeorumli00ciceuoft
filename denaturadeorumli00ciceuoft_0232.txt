204 NOTES.

signs which the gods gave chiefly through the ssight of birds, but also by
means of various animaIS, of celestial phenomena, especially lightning ἃς.
harioli were soothsayers, who made a business of foretelling the future
from all sorts os signs sor pay ; they are always mentioned with contempt,
while the augurs at Rome were a corporation compos-ed os distinguished
citizens, and the haruspices, though Etruscans, and hence foreigners (11,
4, 11), formed a college and were osten consulted on affairs of state. vales
were inspired seers, prophets ; coniectores were interpreters of dreams.

48. 35. His terroribus. This idea, like that noticed above c. 16, 43,
is characteristic os the school. The Epicureans considered it as one of the
greatest merits of their master that he had freed thern not only from
superstition, but from every sort os sear of the gods. Comp. Lucret. Book
V at the beginning, and Plutarch, Xon posse suaviter vivi ἃς. c. 8.

49. 6. non tarn . . . audiendi, i.e. the important point for me was,
not so much to make a dis-course mysels, as to draw you out, and to hear
what you could say in answer.

49. 14. [‹lisputata, “ advanced in argument.’']

49. 15. de familiari illo tuo. 'she allusion is os course to some
person very well known to those present, whom sor this reason it was un-
necessary to name ; and as in De Or. ΙΙΙ, 21, 78 the orator L. Crassus is
called a familiaris of Velleius, this seems to have induced some old critic
to insert his name here, where it is found in several MSS. The calling the
Romans togatis aster their national costume would be rather expected from a
foreigner, and may be defended by similar passages as De Orat. 1, 24, 111 ;
111, 11‚43 ; but it is not known that L. Crassus was particularly well versed
in philosophy, especially that of Epicurus, or that he was the champion os it
at that time ; but this he must have been to make it possible sor Cotta to
appeal to his judgment as he does here. F0r these reasons we are in-
clined with Madvig, note to Cic. De Fin. I, 5, 16, to refer the passage to
the Epicurean Phaedrus, who perhaps stood in a similar intimate relation
to Velleius as Diodotus did to Cicero. See c. 3, 6.

49. 16. videor· audisse. The full expression is milti Μόρον,- but the
pronoun being easily understood is often omitted. Comp. ΙΙ, 46, 1175 61,
153. For further examples see Beier¹s note to De Offic. 1, 1, 1.

49. 22. quam solent vestri. Itis often stated that the Epicureans
laid very little weight on the form os discourse, and the extant fragments
os Philodemus and Epicurus too confirm it. lllinime aptum ad dicendum
genus they are called in Cic. Brut. c. 35, 131.

49. 22. Zenonem. Ζήνων ὑ Σιδώνιος, ἀκροατὴς Ἀπολλοδώρου, πολυγρά-
φος ἀνὴρ, καὶ νοῆσαι καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι σαφὴς. Diog. L. X, 25 and VII, 36.
