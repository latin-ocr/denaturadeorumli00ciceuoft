2 1 2 NOTES.

54. 3¹· physice, ironically‚ as ΙΙ, 18, 48. Comp. c. 30, 83.

54. 31. quasi sui . . . lena. Nature, or the peculim· natural consti·
tution os any being, presents itself to such being as the most beautiful3 as
a lena recommends to her customers the attractions she offers them.

55. 3. eam esse eausam &a This part os the sentence can only de-
pend on quid mirum, and would force the reader to take the preceding si
. . . putaret as an inserted conditional clause, and not, as would be most
natural, with quid mirum directly. Resides, as it here stands, it presents
a violation os the consecutio temporum not easy to explain. Finally, it is
evidently quite superfluous ς and would have been better lest out, if indeed
Cicero really wrote it. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, 317. 18.

⁴⁸ sented with two bodies of fishes instead of feet ; therefore natantibus inve·

tenth one, hundredth one ’' ; i.e. “ what proportion of men is handsome? ’‘]

companies in the gymnasia for exercise in common.

55. 19. vitia saepe iucunda. See the same topic treated in Lucre-
tius IV, 1154 ff. Comp. also Hor. Sat. Ι, 3, 40.

sional mention is made, as for instance Cic. Tuse. IV, 33, 71, and some
fragments remain.
