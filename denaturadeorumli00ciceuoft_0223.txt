BOOK I.—-CuAi¹. XIV, ἓξ 35—37. 195

Or shall we assume that Cicero thought to put a somewhat inappropriate
expression in the mouth of the Epicurean?

43. 23· astris. See 11, 15.

4 3. 24. annis, mensibus διο. Evidently a perversion, to which Zeno's
allegorical explanations of the mythological gods perhaps gave occasion.

43. ²5· Hesiodi theogeniam interpretatur. Zeno certainly wrote
no particular commentary on the 'sheogony, but only referred to it in his
writings on natural philosophy, such as περὶ κόσμου, and explained the
theogonio fables allegorically‚ per quandam ugni-ficationem as is stated
below, in harmony with his system.

¹ 43. 26. usitatas perceptasque. See note to 11, 39, 91.--00gn1-
tiones =notiones, as below c. 17, 44.

43. 30. Aristonis of Chios, not be confounded with the Peripatetic 37
of the sanie name from Ceos. We have no other information regarding
his doctrines, and hence can form no judgment of the correctness of the
statement here made.

43. 33. Cleanthes of Assus in Lycia, Zeno’s successor as head of ‘he‘
Stoic school.

43. 34. ipsum mundum. Zeno had done the same before. See ΙΙ,
8, 21.

43. 35. totius naturae menti atque animo, i.e. to the soul of the
universe. This is a repetition of t'ne idea of the preceding phrase; for
the universe is only called God, because it is filled with and animated by
the universal soul. Comp. Varro in August. De Civit. Dei VII, 6: Hunc
ipsum mundum esse deum ,· sed sicul hominem sapientem, cum sit ex cor-
pore et animo, lamen ab animo dici sapientem, ita mundum deum dici ab
animo, quum sit ex animo et corpore.

44. 1. ultimum . . . ardorem. Also the same thing in another form 3
for it is the fiery ether that partly encompasses the universe, partly peue-
trates it as its soul.

44. 7. in animi notione . . . reponere. Epicurus assumed the ΕΚ·
istence of an innate idea, the so-called πρόληψις, of God (see c. 16, 43);
a god, to be entitled to our belief, must coi-respond to this inmte idea,
must fit into this mould, so to speak ; and this is itself the pr00f Whether
he is really a god ς just as, if we wished to ascertain whether a foot were
the one it purported to be, we were to place it in one of its spot-prims, and
judge from the-result. Comp. Plato Republ.‚ p. 462 A: ἄρα ἂ νῦν διήλθο-
μεν εἰς τὸ τοῦ ἡγηθηῖι ῖχνης ἦιιῑυ ἀρμόττεις so also Cicero Orat. e. 38, 133²
ea oratio (Demosthenis de Corona) in eam formam, quae est insita in
mentibus nostris, includi sic potest, ut maior eloquentia non requiratur ,·

where the idea is also the frame into which the work of art must fit. So
ibid. c. 5, 15.
