16 DE NATURA DEORUM.

treatise, considering the coincidence of several passages above
alluded to, but not quite certain3 for similar notices and opinions
doubtless occurred in many other Epicurean documents.¹

The discourses assigned by Cicero to the Academic in the first
book against the Epicurean doctrine, and in the third book against the
Stoics, were without any doubt taken from one os the many writings
of Clitomachus. There existed no less than four hundred books os
thislflissosopher‚in uluch he had inade note of the oralteachings
of his master Carneades. But not only does Cicero himself several
times appeal to Carneades, but many os the arguments which he
makes against the Stoics are found in the same form in Sextus Em-
piricus in the ninth book of the treatise against the mathematicians‚
i.e.‚ against the dogmatics. and they are there ascribed to Carneades.
Although they are in part evidently sophistical, they are still in gen-
eral well adapted to prove what Cicero makes Cotta say, that there «
is a great difference between religious saith and scientific knowledge ς
that saith rests upon something different from dialectic argument,
and that whoever seeks to found it upon such runs the risk rather of
weakening it. But we may well suppose that many among the
ancients were reasonable enough to see with Cotta that saith itself
was not overthrown by the refutation of insufficient rational grounds,
and that there was such a thing as an immediate certainty os saith,
independent os the strength or weakness of logical arguments.²

1 This is also the opinion of the reviewer of the Herculanensia, published by
Drummond and walpole (London, 1810), in the Quarterly Review, Vol. 111,
No. 5, p. 15.

² A te enim philosopho rationem accipere debeo relzgionis, maioribus etiam
nulla ratione reddita credere says Cotta ΙΙΙ, 2, 6. Now it is os course beyond
all doubt that it was utterly impossible for a thinking man at that time really to
hold such a position toward all the tenets of the traditional religion os the
people as Cotta in this passage professes himself to hold, and that much, per-
haps the ,most of it, was professed only for political reasons as a means to any
thing but religious ends ς but still it would not be just for this reason utterly
to deny to the thinkers os those times any religious saith whatever, as has in fact
been done. ¹¹ What is more unworthy of a philosopher than to deny the exist-
ence of the gods? ’⁸ says Cotta 111, 17, 44 ς and he was certainly sincere. ssut
the appeal to the tradition handed down from the foresathers indicates in gen-
eral a consciousness that a real knowledge of divine things is impossible for man,
and that therefore religion, which as a matter os fact was everywhere existent,
must have some other source than knowledge. 1t is not to be wondered at
