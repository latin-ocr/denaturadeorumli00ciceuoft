202 NOTES.

pictures constantly coming to us from innumerable individual natm-es:—
in the next place, tum, our minds upon reflection arrive at the conception
os a nature that is happy and immortal, i.e. the nature of the gods. The
clause cum i'finil‘l . . . adstuat seems to be better taken with what pre-
cedes than with what follows; comp. ξ 108 fin. l-'luenlinm frequenter
transilio fil vz'sionum‚ ut e mullis una videatur J also Dlog. L. X, 139:
τοὺς θεοὺς λάμ..) θεωρητοὺς sivae· . . . οὓς δὲ κατὰ ὁμοειδιάν ἑκ τῆς συνεχοῦς
ἑπιρῥίυεως τῶν ὁμοίων εἰδώλων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀποτετελεσμένωτ ἁνθρωποειδῶς.]
5ο 47. 25. si mortalium . . .et si, quae interimant. See Introd.,
p. 25 sor the misconception occasioned by the order of these two phrases.
47. 28. Balbe, soletis, that is, you and your school ; as in De Orat.

0 Calliope, precor, adspirate canenti. Tibull. Ι, 3, 1 ε Ibitis Aegaeas sine
me, Messalla, per mulas.
51 47. 30. Nihil enim agit. We should expect agunt,- but such tran-
sitions from plural to singular, when classes of things are in question, are
frequent, as also from singular to plural. See below c. 36, 101 ; 38, 1065

41, 113. 114.

24,) 48. 4. vicissitudines ordinesque, equivalent to earumque ordines,

δ’ or vicissitudines ordinatas, as a hendiadys.

53 48. 8. natura, blind, unconscious force of nature, as c. 13, 35. Comp.
also note to c. 24, 67.

48. 11. innumerabilis mundos. The reasons of Epicurus sor as-
suming a large number of worlds may be seen in Lucretius ΙΙ, 1052 ff.
But they only amount to this, that the contrary cannot be proved. More-
over Epicurus was not the first to assume the existence os several worlds.
Comp. above c. 10, 25, and Stobacus Ecl. I, p. 496.

48. 12. [Quod quia. Quod thus used is much less frequently found
with quia than with si, nisi,· it connects the soregoing with what follows,
introduces a step in the argument. Comp. De Fin. Ι, 20, 67. Madvig
Gram. ξ 449 ; Roby Gram. ξ 2214]

48. 12. [sine aliqua mente, “without some mind or other.” So in
II, 66, 167: Nemo igilur vir magnus sine aliquo afflatu divino umquam
suit. And so generally with sine when the sentence is negative in form
aliquis is used; De Isin. 111, 9, 30, negative from the force of mancam ,-
ibid. 111, 11, 37. On the other hand when the sentence is affirmative ullus
is used. Cic. De Rep. I, 43, 673 ΙΙ, 11, 223 11, 39, 663 sine ulla dubita-
tione. Tusc. 111, 3, 5; Balb. 13, 31; Catil. IV, 3, 5; Verr. II, 4, 18, ἓ 39
