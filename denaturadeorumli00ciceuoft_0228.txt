200 NOTES.

material, therefore the impressions in virtue of which the mind conceives
the ideas of the gods must proceed from something material ; i.e. the gods
must be material. But their matter must be of another and finer sort than
that of the objects which affect our bodily organs of sense ς otherwise we
should perceire them with these organs, which is not the case. Comp.
Lucr. V, 149. It is this other, liner matter of the gods, which affects the
mind directly without the interposition of the bodily sense-organs, that is
here called quasi corpus, quasi sanguis.

47. 13. [docet eam Sec. As this passage has been very much dis-
cussed‚ we give here the text of Schoemann, followed by his notes, adding
afterwards comments upon the text in the present edition. Sch.: Epicurus
. . . docet eam esse vim et naturam deorum, ut primum non sensu, sed ’
mente cernantur, nec soliditate quadam nec ad numerum, ut ea quae ille
propter firmitatem στερέμνια appellat, sed imaginibus, similitudine et transi-
tione perceptis; quum[que] infinita simillimarum imaginum species ex
innumerabilibus individuis existat et ad nos affluat, cum maximis volupta-
tibus in eas imagines mentem intentam infixamque nostram intelligentiam
capere, quae sit et beatae naturae et aeternae. It is to be noticed that S.
reads cernantur, divides the passage at perceptis, reads quum [que], species,
ad nos, beatae naturae et aeternae] —primum. The corresponding de-
inde is omitted3 it might stand before cum in the next sentence where que
is wanting in the Mss.—non sensu sed mente. See above note on
quasi corpus.—1n this same sense occurrit § 46 is to be taken, of ideas
which occur to the mind when awake or in a dream; comp. Sext. Em·
pir. IX, 25.—-nec soliditate quadam &o Epicurus called the solid
bodies perceived by the senses στερέμνια, as distinguished from the εῑὸωλα,
i.e. more attenuated atomic formS, which, similar in form to the solid
bodies, stream forth from them: ἁπόρροιαι τὴν ἑξῆς (ii-ow καὶ τάξιν διατη-
ροῦσαι, ἡιπερ καὶ ἑν τοῖς στερεμνίοις εἶχον, Diog. L. X, 46.—-The bodies
of the gods are not στερήιιιία, and the atomic forms which flow from them
are, as Lucretius IV, 732 teaches, multo magis tenuia textu, quam quae
percutiunt oculos visumque lacessunt. These last have a coarser constitu-
tion, which Cicero denotes 'oy soliditas: the divine atoms have not this
soliditas, cannot therefore soliditate quadam cerni like the στερέμνια.-

come into the mind: Fluentium frequenter transitio fit visionum, ut e
multis una videatur, from which may be inferred that Epicurus taught
