INTRODUCTION. 1 7

It remains now to add something in regard to the persons whom
Cicero has introduced as advocates of the three schools of philoso-
phy. We know little more of the Epicurean Velleius, probably os
Lanuvium (see Orelli on 1, 29. 82), than that he was tribune os the
people in the year 664. In De Orat. 111. 21, 78, Cicero calls him a
familiare& of the famous orator L. Licinius Crassus, but himself
rudem in (licendi effrenatione. We will not discuss the truth of the
compliment that he was considered the most noted representative
among the Romans of the Epicurean school. Lucretius, of whom
we have a didactic poem. excellent in its way, on the Epicurean phi-
losophy, was much younger than Velleius, but was no longer living
when Cicero wrote this.

We know no more of the speaker for the Stoic school than we
learn from Cicero. lt seems from a fragment of the Ciceronian
Hortensius (Orelli. p. 484) that he was also introduced in that
treatise as one of the speakers.

therefore that the idea sprang up, that the gods had once revealed to man some-
what about themselves and their relation to him and to the universe, more or
less, according to his need of 01· capacity to receive such revelation. And it
was so very evident that such original revelation had been in the course of time
in many ways misunderstood and counterfeited, misrepresented and corrupted,
now from carelessness, now from mahee, that no sensible man could shut his
eyes to the fact ; but there was the greatest variety of views as to how far one
could or must go in separating the true from the false, revelation from the
devices of men, what was to be held from what to be rejected. There were
believers and free-thinkers of all grades ; but we can no more say that the free-
thinker must necessarily and unconditionally have been destitute of saith, than
that the believer necessarily believed everything.— ln regard to the appeal to
a revelation made to the men of old, an appeal which, more or less seriously
meant, occurs innumerable times among the ancients, the reader is referred to
the essay os Prof. Schoemann, ⁴· Ueber das sittlich-religiose Verhalten der Grie-
chen‚'' Greifswald‚ 1848, p. 35. ——There is no want of modern well—known and
much-read delineations of the religious condition of the thinkers of those times,
the authors of which take pleasure in bringing out into prominence chiefly the
weaknesses and errors from which of course few were free, but who allow
nothing like a really religious feeling, and are especially fond of ridiculing the
Stoic religious philosophy as empty talk. This is easily explained. The writers
of these descriptions stand upon much higher ground, and cannot easily recog-
nize in others a religious frame of mind that is so far inferior to their own.
