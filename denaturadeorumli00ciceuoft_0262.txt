is not so because Cotta had finished his discourse and because, as Balbus
knew, the Academic had nothing positive to say on the subject ; Balbus
calls attention to it this way. The tense os inducat may be more than an
oversight. “1 should have preferred to hear Cotta continue his speech
rather than leave off where he did, and sce how he gets on when lie comes
to propound a system of positive theology; he ought to have one and 1
am curious to know what it is.’‘]

79. 3. istam quaestionem. This pronoun is used because the per-
son addressed is the one who proposes the discussion, and who also last
spoke. On iste referring to the person addressed see Reisig, Vorl. ξ 209.

79. 7. sumamus, of subjects which one takes up for discussion. De
Orat. 11, 90, 366 ι quis Antonio permisit, ut et partis faceret et utram vel-
let prior ipse sumeret ε’

79. 16. Ennius, who more than any one else made the Romans
acquainted with the works and various forms of Greek poetry, modelled
his tragedies chiefly upon the plays of Euripides. The verse here quoted

is from the Thyestes. For others os similar import see below e. 25, 65. ’Δ

[Schoemann reads sublimen and remarks ι] Festus (p. 306 M) appar-
ently vouches sor the form sublimen (subst.) as having been used by En-
nius ; but this is not quite certain. [Baiter also has sublimen in both
editions.]

79. 18. lovem. The ancients recognized the fact that the name Iovis
(properly Diovis) signified “the heavenly” (see Varro L. L.‚ V, 66), and
modern comparative pliilology has confirmed it. dium too means the
heavens, the bright sky, which spreads the light of day (dies) over the
earth. Ζεύς, Acci-g, deus, θεός are of the same root ; and the supreme
being bears the distinctive name os “heavenly father,” Dius pater, Dius·
piler, Diespiter, luppiter. The Stoic however completely identifies God
with the heavens, indeed he makes the heaverily ether God, as older phi-
losophers had already done before him, whose views Euripides assigns to
his heroes in some os his tragedies.—In the following mum vero et
lovem Balbus has in mind the supposed derivation of the name from
iuvare, e. 25, 64.

79. 21. patrem divumque &e.‚ equivalent to the Homeric πατὴρ
ἄνὸρῶν τε θεῶν τε. The Stoic however understands thereby the creator,
while in Homer and the other poets the name Zeus does not designate the
creator, but only a paternal ruler; this is noted by Arist. Polit. 1, 12.
Cf. Div. Chrys. Or, XII, 75 ς πατὴρ δὲ (Zeis) καλεῖται διά τε τὴν κηδεμο-
νίαν καὶ τὸ πρᾳοι·.

79. 24. cognitum conprehensumque. The second word defines
the first more precisely, and in the Stoic sense is to be understood of a
