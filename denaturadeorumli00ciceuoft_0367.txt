they seem to make no difference between these two, unless it be that the
second denotes especially the beings nearest to man ; just as nian‘s reason-
able soul is· osten called the demon that dwells in him. This whole class
os subordinate beings appears in general to be employed in the service os
the supreme being, filled with the divine Logos‚ and hence friendly dis-
posed to men; men have a diunner and less vivid consciousness os the
divine Logos, which needs quiekening and strengthening ; and in this they
are aided by these inferior beings, who aet as mediators between them and
the highest God, with whom direct communication seems to be hardly con-
ceivable. In this sense Antoninus IX, 40 recommends men to pray to the
gods sor moral light and strength; Zeus, that is the supreme being, says
Epictetus, Diss. Ι, 14, 12, has given to every man his demon to watch over
him. Man, says he (111, 24, 60), must strix-e to be on friendly terms with
the gods, he must be mindsul that he is related to them (Ι, 9, 11 and 23),
and hence must try to be like them. These teachings are really only another
form of expression for the highest moral law ὁμυὶῃγοιῑιιὲνως τῇ φύσει ζῇνς
sor it is the higher nature of man that is here in question, which manifests
itself as the divine Logos in the reason and conscience, and constitutes his
relationship with the gods. Τῳ λογικῷ ζώῳ ἡ ‹zi-rr> πρᾶξις κατὰ φύσιν ἐστὶ καὶ
κατὰ λόγον. Antonin. VII, 11.

ΊἹιε ethical doctrines of the Stoics have thus an essentially religious
character, though not a theological one ; the theologica! portion is limited
to a very few simple proposifions, which would rather recommend than
injure them in the eyes of many. Not to enter more sully into the subject
a single point may· be mentioned, which has been noticed by Simplicius in
his commentary to Epictetus, Enchir., p. 8. He says: καὶ τοῦτο δ’ ἀι· τις
τῶν λό) ων τούτων θαυμάσειεν, ὃτι τοὺς πειθομένους καὶ ἑργαζομὲιόυς τὰ 71:76-
μευα μακαρίους ἀποτελοῦσι καὶ εὐδαίμονας, οὐδὲν δεηθέντες τὰς μετὰ θάνατον
τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀμοιβὰς ὲπαγγὲὶλεσθαι, κᾶν πάντως &naimonem καὶ οἰκ-αι, And
so it really is; Epictetus never refers to a reward to be expected after
death. Although the Stoics never denied the continuing existence of the
soul after death, many of them having expressly professed their belief in it,
yet they never presumed to speak of a suture judgment‚ of punishment of
the wicked and of rewards sor the righteous. Of course they thus surren-
dered a motive for well doing, which may be the most powerful for the

majority of people, and which for this reason cannot be abandoned in a
eatechetical instruction intended for the multitude.
