SUMMARV. 27

Moreover Epicurus ought properly to have said, not that the gods
had the form of men, but that men had the form of gods, because
the godS‚ as being immortal, must have existed before men.¹ Or
else he must have assumed that, when the human race came into
being, chance which brought the atoms together made such a won-
derful hit that men sprang up similar to the gods: and it would not
be worth the trouble to argue against this (89, 9ο). But further-
more, the human form would be quite useless to the gods, because
they have not the same necessities and occupations to which the
human organization is adapted (91-94). And if thc human form is
still insisted upon for the gods, because without it they cannot pos-
sess reason, and hence cannot be happy, the objection must be
repeated that it is idle to maintain that reason can only exist in
union with the human form because we have never seen it joined
with any other, and on the other hand not to see how absurd it is
to attribute to the gods limbs and organs for which they can have
no possible use, being according to Epicums entirely without activity
of any sort: a view, be it observed‚ which strips the gods of that
very thing which in reality is essentia] to any happiness (95—102).
Suppose we grant that the gods have the human form: where do
they live ? Do they ever change their abode ? And why ? Have
they any impulses at all ? Do they make any use of their reason ?
Lastly, on what ground are they called immortal and happy ?— The
only answer the Epicureans have for all these questions is to talk

1 The Academic here takes ¹¹ immortal'' (aeterni) as importing “without
beginning ’” as well as “without end.'' But Epicurus only spoke of the life of
the gods as being endless and imperishable, which was also the popular belief:
he considered the gods not as without beginning, but as having come into being.
In order, if not to prove, at least to render this immortality possible and credi-
ble, he had recourse to the law of isonomy, which required imperishable as the
counterpart to perishable beings. Admitting the gods however to have had a
beginning, he was not at all obliged to assume that their existence was prior to
that of the human race. Moreover the assumption that the gods had the
human form did not necessarily involve the other, that their form was imitated
from it, but only that it was similar to the human form. This similarity he
maintained to be a fact of universal consciousness¹ in virtue of the πρόληψις
resulting from the impressions coming to us from the gods: he added other
reasons only as cumulative arguments. XVhen his adversaries regarded this
similarity as a wonderful freak of chance, he hardly needed to mind it: for, so
long as the firct was established, he could not be expected to explain the reason.
