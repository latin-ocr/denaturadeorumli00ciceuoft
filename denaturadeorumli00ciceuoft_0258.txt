66. 31. Sanctitas . . . scientia colendorum deorum. This corre-
sponds to the Stoic detinition of εὐσέβεια in Diog. L. Vll, 119: εἶναι δὲ
τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἐπιστήμην θεῶν θεραπειης. Comp. Xen. Mem. IV, 6, 4; and

tagoram3 note to c. 12, 29.
67. 8. totam de dis inmortalibus opinionem fictam. This opin-

dence for it are some verses which Plutarch (De Plac. Phil. 1, 7) cites
from the Sisyphus of Euripides, but which others ascribe to Critias. Comp.
Introd, pp. 6, 7.
67. 11. Prodicus Cius, a Sophist of the Socratic age, and in many

67. ι7. Euhemero, from R‘Iessina in Sicily, at the end of the fourth
century B.C., a friend of the Macedonian Cassander ; he wrote a ἱερὰ ἀνα-
mmor), professedly based on documents which he claimed to have found in
the temple of Zeus Triphylios on an island of the Southern ocean called
Panchaia 3 according to these documents all the gods of the popular belief,
from Uranus down, were nothing more than deified kings and heroes of
early times. Extracts from his book are given especially in Diodor. V, 42
ff.; and Euseb. Praep. Evang. 11, 4. Ennius translated it into Latin, and
a number of passages of the translation are found in Lactant. Inst. Div. I,

Gerlach in his Histor. Studien, p. 137 ff„ treat of Euhemerus at length.

pending on ultimae. Ultima orarum, “the extreme of the boundaries.²²
[But this would require the genitive ultimae to depend on gentes, which
seems rather forced. Why not gentes ultimae orarum, as in Hor. Od. 1,
35 ultimos orbis Britannos, or Tac. Agr. c. 30 lVos terrarum ac libertatis
extremos ,Ρ “the most remote people of the countries,’' instead of“ the people
