3001< 1.-cfflu›. xxv. xxm, §5 67-71· ²09

Probably Epicurus did not say exactly what Cicero here states, but only
that the so-called principle exclusi tertii does not hold unconditionally,
inasmuch asin alternative propositions referring to the future it is quite
possible that neither of the alternatives may be true. Comp. Prantl, Ge-
schichte der Logik 1, p. 403 ; and Zeller 111 ², 1, p. 391.

[Zeller 111 ¹, p. 233 thinks that Epicurus did not mean to impeach the
formal correctness of the disjunction, but only the material truth os the two
propositions. He did not deny then that of two contradictory cases one
or the other must occur, that the statement was true that ‘Epicurus will be
either alive or dead to-morrow ’ 3 but he denied only the truth of the two
propositions each taken by itself, 2'.e. he denied the truth of the proposi-
tions ‘ Epicurus will live: and ⁴ Epicurus will not live‚' because either one
becomes true only when the actual occurrence takes place]

52. 33. omnis sensus veri nuntios. Lucretius IV, 480 ff. gives
Epicurus's reasons ; namely that what is called illusion of the senses is
not the fault οἱ the senses themselves, but of a wrong interpretation of the
sensuous impression3 sce ibid. 464 ff.

52, 34. Nihil . . . niniis callido for admodum or valde callide. So
non nimis for “ not extremely.’‘ Cic. Div. in Caecil. c. 22, 71 ε Hoc statu-
ere, iudices, debetis, Caecilium non nimis lianc causam severe, non nimis
accurate, non nimis diligenter acturum. T use. V, 33, 93: non nimis
sortasse subtiliter, utiliter tamen ‚· Acad. 11, 47, 146: nec tamen nimis
eleganter.

53. 1. dum individuorum corporum concretionem fugit. Epi· 71
curus did not deny that the bodies of the gods consisted of atoms; he
denied only the concretio, i.e. the thicker, more compact constitution of
their bodies. Comp. 27, 75. So for example in ΙΙ, 39, 101 he opposes
concretus αὲν to fiisus et extenuatus ,· crassum caelum etque concretum ΙΙ,
16 in.; pingue et concretum coelum, De Divin. 1, 57, 130; nimis concreti
humores, below ΙΙ, 23, 59 3 terrena concretaque corpora, Tusc. 1, 18,
42. But it is certainly untrue that Epicurus attributed to the gods this
finer, more subtle constitution of body simply for the reason here assigned
by Cotta. See Summary, p. 20, n. 1 ; and for the true reason see note to
c. 18, 49.

53. 3. sed tamquam corpus, se. esse ait, supplied from the preceding
negat,· as De Fin. V, 29, 88: Ille Metelli vitam negat beatiorem quam
Reguli, praeponendam tamen ‚· a frequent ellipsis. So nolo . . . sed, c. 7,

17.

53. 4. Mirabile videtur διε. Comp. De Div. 11, 24, 51 where this 26
sentiment is assigned to the elder Cato.
